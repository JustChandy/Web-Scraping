Wayfair Canada,2021-02-12T15:55:46+00:00,1,Purchased a portable fridge / Freezer. When I did not get it quickly I went on line and discovered that they had lowered the price by $150 plus the appropriate  tax of 13%. I contacted customer service to request a price adjustment but was told that they do not do that. In fact their representative had a very non caring attitude and said that they don’t ask for money if the price goes up. I was told that if I refused delivery that I may have a problem getting my account refunded. I emailed Wayfair with my issue and a request for a senior customer service representative to contact me . To date I have not heard back from anyone. I now have the product delivered and have not opened it yet as I do not want any excuses not to refund my account when I return the item. If Wayfair is interested in customer service the should be addressing their customers complaints. I do not think that it is unreasonable to request a price adjustment especially when the customer has not even taken delivery of the item. Hoping for a satisfactory resolution to this complaint other than returning the item
Wayfair Canada,2021-02-11T13:36:55+00:00,1,"I ordered 6 chairs with a table.  I received first 3 chairs that were a wrong color but after I reached out to customer service and got a bit of a discount, I received the rest of the shipment with some defect and a bug in my package. 
I would have to think twice about reordering again."
Wayfair Canada,2021-02-10T23:33:02+00:00,1,"Really bad company. They do not deliver on the date they stated they would deliver. So I asked for a refund. 

They then said the purolator driver had a breakdown, which is a lie, as I saw the the driver's  truck outside, and got his message that he attempted deliver, but I was here and got no notice of a delivery attempt.

They then then said the item would have to be delivered before I could get a refund!

Lol, what a pile of crap!

Do not buy from this company! They are a scam!"
Wayfair Canada,2021-02-10T20:04:02+00:00,1,"This company has the worst service i have ever experienced online.  I ordered blinds in November 2019. They have lost them 2 times so far. I receive one on February 6, 2020 and the other 2 are being resent for the 3rd time.

As of February, 10, 2020 they still have no delivery date for my remaining blinds and will not expedite the delivery. They simply say it is not possible. 

I have called repeatedly and been disconnected over and over. They have had my money for over 3 months yet I still do not have my product.

I will never order from this place again and I highly recommend you consider elsewhere before ordering."
Wayfair Canada,2021-02-08T23:10:05+00:00,1,"They have great options for unique products, but not reliable to deliver on time or hold themselves accountable for their poor business design. If you have 2-3 months to wait for your item, could be good. But if you need it within their delivery timeframe (normally 2-3 weeks), DO NOT USE THEM. It is close to mid February and I'm still waiting on items ordered early January. It was supposed to arrive January 26th, then Feb 15th, then Feb 19th...just checked again and now its feb 23rd. Betting that will change again. Terrible experience. Aweful!!"
Wayfair Canada,2021-02-07T15:43:37+00:00,1,"From time to time, I have visited the Wayfair.ca site to compare shop. I have yet to buy anything because I find the prices quite high overall. Fabrics are very expensive and for some reason Wayfair sells by the yard. The yard!!!... in Canada! I give up! I'm finding good quality products elsewhere at very reasonable prices and no longer see the point in visiting Wayfair anymore. I have in the meantime found quality & reasonably priced fabrics sold by the metre via several Canadian online stores not to mention other items for my household."
Wayfair Canada,2021-02-06T22:54:07+00:00,1,"I had read many negative reviews of Wayfair, but the products looked so good on the site. We took a chance and ordered a make-up vanity for $300. It ended up being the BIGGEST hunk of junk imaginable. Pieces of cheap OSB, flimsy, crooked junk. Never again!!!!"
Wayfair Canada,2021-02-06T03:09:03+00:00,1,"I ordered a Treanor Floating Desk and waiting about 3 weeks for it to come in, not complaining how long it took to deliver, but, when I opened up my package there where missing nails, parts, and the instructions to build this desk was absolutely horrible and confusing. I didn’t want to email them explaining that there where nails missing and that I had to improvise with my own because I wasn’t about to wait another 3 weeks and didn’t wanna deal with the hassle with returning the whole desk as I am in need of one urgently. I think it’s safe to say I will never order from here again, back to IKEA I go."
Wayfair Canada,2021-02-05T18:49:21+00:00,1,We placed an order Wayfair and the delivery was supposed to be 3 - 5 days and it has been 4 weeks and they just keep making excuses .We had to cancel a plumber twice at our expense and Wayfair hasn't even offered any compensation will never deal with them again
Wayfair Canada,2021-02-04T12:17:48+00:00,1,Placed order and received wrong item. Sent back and was charged for returning.Not happy for first time user.Still waiting on refund
Wayfair Canada,2021-02-04T04:38:28+00:00,1,"I was looking for an item to receive it as fast as it was possible. After checking in multiple stores I decided to purchase the item from Wayfair as it was going to be delivered in the next 3 days. The item didn't arrive and still hasn't been shipped. In fact the order now says that it will arrive 16 days later than the original estimation. That's too late for my needs so I went to cancel the order, but I was shocked when I was told that t wasn't possible (even if it hasn't shipped yet at the time of writing this review). I was told to return the item once I receive it, but they will charge me $12 for doing the return. It's a total nonsense.

I don't recommend Wayfair at all. You don't have any protection as a customer for all the things that can go wrong that are usually their fault."
Wayfair Canada,2021-02-03T14:54:22+00:00,1,"TOTAL SCAM, I spent 2 nights preparing a HUGE order for my house renovations, then paid and received a confirmation, then 2 days later order was cancelled without any excuses, and no customer service picks the phone for an hour now"

Wayfair Canada,2021-02-01T23:53:36+00:00,1,"Paid $70 for some ""blackout curtains"" that took around 3 months to arrive and they are certainly not blackout. In fact they are just fabric they haven't even been sewn with holes to put curtain hooks in! Absolute waste of money. None of the description or photos matched the received product, these ""curtains"" are about 20cm width and not that long, they're literally just sample bits of fabric, I was totally mislead. They have made it impossible to return, so I'd REALLY like a refund - especially being unemployed now due to the pandemic, think I'd benefit much more from having the $70 than this company that keeps ripping people off. I had heard really good things about Wayfair so am very disappointed my order wasn't like I had expected."
Wayfair Canada,2021-02-01T18:15:36+00:00,1,Made an order and then right afterwards discovered was wrong size. Requested cancellation within minutes of ordering but received a email next day that order cannot be cancelled as already shipped. What a farce and wayfair is a bunch of liars as there is no way was shipped within minutes of ordering. I will never buy anything with wayfair ever again as they are scammers!!
Wayfair Canada,2021-02-01T16:14:47+00:00,1,Price fluctuations and sneaky online price changes. Have to be carful before ordering from Wayfair until they go back to providing a price adjustment and better return policies.
Wayfair Canada,2021-01-31T23:01:24+00:00,1,"Wayfair sells cheap and products which have little or no value. Then when you have a complaint, they wash their hands and tell you to contact someone else, even though you purchased the product from them.  Wayfair is a joke of a company and we should all boycott buying from this company. Most of their products are from China anyway - cheap!!!!!! and not well made.  Wayfair is a disgrace!"
Wayfair Canada,2021-01-31T03:09:17+00:00,1,"I would recommend that no one EVER buy ANYTHING from wayfair. I ordered a desk for my teen daughter for Christmas in early november which was supposed to arrive in 2 weeks, it has been 12 weeks now and no item, no refund. I have complained many times to their customer service email and still no one has been able to refund me or get a desk to me. This is a seller that will NOT make mistakes right. It feels like I have been robbed for hundreds of dollars by wayfair."
Wayfair Canada,2021-01-29T15:20:18+00:00,2,I have ordered previously from Wayfair. It was easy to order but in asking questions about replacement parts l was brushed off several times. The only answer l got when asking where l could get a replacement filter for an air purifier was that it comes with a filter. I don't care if l have to call China fir it but not answering a simple but important aspect of the purchase. I have to assume l bought a disposable product that l simply throw away when the filter needs replacing. I will not order from Wayfair again.
Wayfair Canada,2021-01-28T20:45:43+00:00,4,"Fast delivery of my order, but not very good quality of the delivered table. I will be more careful before I choose what to buy next time."
Wayfair Canada,2021-01-28T01:37:16+00:00,1,I received two dining room chairs. One arrived in a box that had very obviously been opened previously and taped back up. It arrived WITH NO LEGS or hardware or hardware. So I then had to make a request to send the legs and hardware and it was very clear that this must happen often because they have this set up on the order listing. So I now have a chair laying on my floor that I cannot use and have no idea how long the parts will take to arrive. I'm shocked that this box was not checked at all before being shipped. Not impressed at all.
Wayfair Canada,2021-01-26T20:22:45+00:00,1,"First time I've ever ordered from Wayfair. Ordered a console table.Cheap material which was okay but parts didn't line up. There's no one to talk with at Wayfair. You have to email and send photos. 
 I won't be ordering anything from them again."
Wayfair Canada,2021-01-25T21:31:50+00:00,1,"Ordered a rug, when it came it was not .37"" pile height as described on the item description, it was barely .25"" and very, very thin.  This is either a defective item, or very misleading information on the item.  The rug had very high reviews and many of them (over 42 000), but only a couple from the past few months.  

Anyway, I requested a refund but they only offered 3 options - 2 require you to return the item, which costs ME money (how is that even fair if the item is defective?) or you do not receive a full refund.  The other option is to keep the item but you only receive a partial refund; just a measly 20%.  I have pictures to prove how thin the rug is and how inaccurate the description is; why can't I get a full refund?  On top of that, nowhere in this process allows you to say what the actual issue is, you just have vague options to choose from.  I selected 'problem with the fabric' but I really wanted to describe what the issue was..how else will Wayfair know there is an issue?

And finally the icing on the cake is that because I got a partial refund, I cannot leave a review.  So that means that the only people that can leave a review are those that are either completely happy with their purchase or that have taken a complete loss.  Which means the reviews are *completely* inaccurate.  It's no wonder the reviews are so good!  I just couldn't figure out why no one mentioned how threadbare the rug is; well, that's why - no ability to leave a review.  It's false advertising and it's sneaky, and now later customers can stumble upon the same rug and make the same, disappointing purchase with no satisfactory way to resolve the situation.  By the way, the seller was Dakota Fields but the actual rug brand was nuLOOM.  Shop elsewhere!"
Wayfair Canada,2021-01-22T17:49:52+00:00,1,"The worthless company, just cheating. They postponed my delivery several times without notice   that I had to refund it and they didn't even say sorry."
Wayfair Canada,2021-01-21T23:43:22+00:00,1,I PURCHASED TWO MATTRESS COVERS WITH THE BRAND NAME OF WHITE NOISE AND I RECEIVED TWO MATTRESS COVERS WITH A DIFFERENT BRAND NAME AND MANUFACTURE. they stated they have the right to change the name without informing me
Wayfair Canada,2021-01-21T22:30:45+00:00,1,I work as an interior designer and have always used wayfair due to their easy return policy and procedures. This time I tried to return something that has been delayed twice now and take over a month to ship before it arrived and the girl on the other line was screaming at me and being terribly rude  I couldn’t believe it there was no argument to be had. There shouldn’t have been any issues with this simple return especially since it was due to their error. Will not go back to using wayfair again
Wayfair Canada,2021-01-19T11:07:18+00:00,2,"I have been shopping at Wayfair for a few years now. I have shopped both for personal and business. Never had a problem, not even once. Until I encountered their Customer Service Dept.

What a disgraceful adventure that has been. I can see where one person might ignore you, but 2? 𝗔𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝘄𝗮𝘀 𝗮 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗿!

So I needed a small chandelier for a closet. I was looking at Wayfair's selection just after Christmas and was happy to find an open box one for $36. Regular price, $169! (all prices are approx.) I hit the red letters to add it to my cart, but it wouldn't take me there. I tried logging out, and back in again; I even tried uninstalling the App and re-installing. Zippo. Obviously a 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗴𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗰𝗵?

So I emailed the issue to them and a Dana A helped me. After the whole back and forth email episode, she offered to order it for me. That was great.

A few days later I went online to check some other orders, which 𝗦𝗧𝗜𝗟𝗟 haven't arrived to date; and I noticed there was no chandelier in my orders! I had not rec'd any confirmations, nothing. So I called. ✵𝒓𝒐𝒍𝒍𝒔 𝒆𝒚𝒆𝒔✵

The Manager I was put through to was very nice, very chatty, but professional. Btw, these ""customer service"" folks, work from home! I could hear her bird and child in the background.

Anyway Ms Nice Manager (Chelsea G.) asked me to send her all the emails, and screenshots. Which I did...a week ago. Guess what? Nothing. Nada. Zilch!

No confirmation of receipt, no email bounce. Just thin air. 𝗧𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗳 𝗰𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿 𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲𝘀 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝘄𝗮𝗹𝗸. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀 𝘄𝗵𝗼 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗼𝘂𝘀𝗹𝘆 𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗼𝘂𝘀𝗮𝗻𝗱𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗱𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗿𝘀!

So after my card is paid off next month, I will be cutting it up. I cannot work with shoddy customer service when I answer to my own clients. This put me in a very awkward situation. One I will not repeat. 

Clearly I cannot trust Wayfair to have any integrity and do what they say they would; and after reading the comments here I'm starting to think I've just been lucky for the past 4 years.

My decision isn't based on one incident or the money. I can't take the chance it will happen again. And from the sounds of things, the odds are that it would."
Wayfair Canada,2021-01-18T23:30:25+00:00,1,"I bought sectional sofa, but it feels cheap quality and i put genuine review with pictures with 3 star, but way fair did not post it. I think if it is 5 star reviews, they will post right away. 
Genuine consumer reviews helps making right decision to buy product online. After covid lockdown i have purchased lot of thing online and reviews really helped me, but this was really disappointing."
Wayfair Canada,2021-01-18T21:55:08+00:00,1,They charged our credit card twice for the same order and we missed other transactions because the credit limit cap was reached. Very rude and unprofessional. Try to avoid them.
Wayfair Canada,2021-01-18T19:14:00+00:00,1,"Horrible experience. Due to covid I'm new to online ordering. 
Ordered product on January 13th, with expected delivery February 16th. Tried canceling the next day. Was denied because was shipped already. On January 14 called customer service to cancel was refused. 
Today January 18th my orders status preparing for shipping. Called again to find out is sitting in California warehouse. REFUSED TO CANCEL. 
Be aware, full of scammers. Once they take your money, not easy to get back"
Wayfair Canada,2021-01-17T03:06:02+00:00,1,Worst company of all time. Will NEVER shop with them again. Customer service Was awful and was lied to. Couldn’t even get a call back about my concerns. Had to call multiple times about being priced gouged only to never get a call back. Products are cheap and overpriced. Same products on “sister” websites sold cheaper with different names and won’t match the “different item”
Wayfair Canada,2021-01-16T05:45:14+00:00,5,"I had a very good experience with all my orders (maybe 10 or more)
Last one, a king mattress delivered in just 2 days.
I am very surprised of all the bad reviews."
Wayfair Canada,2021-01-15T19:38:49+00:00,1,"Wrong order sent by Wayfair; waited to have a replacement sent and was told coming out at the end of December 2020, was informed that the product wouldn't be available until November 2021. Now I'm left with the original wrong order that was more expensive than the first order (no price matching). Unfortunate. Won't shop with Wayfair anymore and I ordered a lot from them."
Wayfair Canada,2021-01-15T16:33:09+00:00,1,"My first and my last purchase.
I bought 2 sofa recliners from WayFair(I'd say WayUnFair) about a year ago. I Also got an extended warranty for them just in case. after a few months Sofa cushions tore apart from underneath the sofa, due to a design flaw. I opened a claim against Wayfair customer service and they deliberately ignored me until 1 year of warranty with them was over (we are talking about 1 month of me following up with their customer service and not getting any response back). Only when the warranty with WayFair was over a WayFair representative contacted me to say sorry for being late. I was informed that since the 1 year period was over I had to follow up with Uniters(The extended warranty service). Uniters of course didn't cover anything and also didn't respond properly on all of our attempts contacting them.

Anyway, I don't recommend buying anything from Wayfair and furthermore waste money on an extended warranty.

The Wayfair customer service stopped responding to me after I asked them to escalate my case to their managers.

The emails that come from Wayfair.ca have invalid links in them. I.e.: the section about rating experience with their customer service!

Very unprofessional and dishonest, I feel deceived and I won't trust Wayfair and Uniters again."
Wayfair Canada,2021-01-14T23:24:34+00:00,1,"A bought a mattress in a box for my elderly parents. Because the mattress weighed 100 pounds I had it delivered directly to their address. I told my parents to leave it in the living room until I could drive up on the weekend. However, I received a call when I was driving about a delivery that I thought was shipping to my home address in Mississauga as I had bought sheets, mattress protector etc for the bed as a surprise . The person  on the phone was very hard to understand and I told him someone was home, leave it with them/ outside the door.  A few hours later I received a call from my father who was very angry. Apparently the delivery is for Peterborough and the drive left it on the street outside the building.   Someone walking by called on the intercom and told my parents that there was a delivery for them.  My father, who is 95 yrs old,  is in bed and not well. My 85 year old mother, who has altimerzer had to find her way down stairs, and somehow got the box up a set of stair in to the lift, falling in the hall, in the process and into the apartment.  What I do not understand is  how you order something that is heavy and leave it outside, expecting that someone will be able to get it home? What was the point of having it delivered to you door when it is left on the street? Shame on FEDEX. . Also I now need to print a copy of the return label and mail or drive it to my parents who are 2.5 hours away as they do not have a printer. This is not customer service. My mother is totally confused and very upset at the experience. By the way the girl who was going to process the claim got cut off from me. Hopefully someone gives me a call to straighten this mess out.  ""I am  sorry"" would have been the way to start the conversation."
Wayfair Canada,2021-01-14T18:18:56+00:00,1,"I have ordered multiple items for our renovations and while the products themselves are (mostly) as described, the ""customer service"" department is abysmal. When purchasing, the advert indicates ""FREE DELIVERY on orders of $50 or more).......I ordered over $1,000 of bathroom accessories and despite the fact that these are smaller items, was charged, not once but twice, for Delivery to the tune of $38........The customer service rep that I spoke with was dismissive, arrogant and disrespectful........NEVER AGAIN!"
Wayfair Canada,2021-01-14T17:58:59+00:00,1,"I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing from Wayfair.  I accidentally placed the same order twice and literally, within about 10 minutes, they  had yanked the money off of my credit card before I had a chance to cancel one of the orders.  They cannot refund yet, have to wait to hear from the ""vendor"" - I actually thought I was ordering from Wayfair, but clearly they are the middleman taking a cut.  I have to wait for delivery, return the item and then await my refund.  What a racket.  Do NOT order from this company."
Wayfair Canada,2021-01-13T18:46:55+00:00,1,"If I could leave zero stars, I would and I would highly advise purchasing elsewhere based on my experience. I've made several purchases through Wayfair over the years and of course have had issues, but nothing like this. I am beyond upset and will not stop pursuing them until I receive my full refund and they remove their defective items from my home. I wanted to order the 5 piece Lydia Dining Set by Kelly Clarkson. 1. It was out of stock. 2. It was priced at $3,500+. However, they sell the exact same table and chairs in the set individually, which oddly cost less than the price of the set that is still out of stock. Obviously I chose to purchase the exact same items that are in the set separately because they were in stock... delayed, but still available. Nov 8, 2020 I added the exact same items that are in the set to my cart... 1 table and 2 sets of 2 chairs. The chairs arrived Nov 19, 2020. I took them out, assembled them and disposed of the packaging. I can't remember the exact date the table arrived, but it was late November. Again, assembled the large table and disposed of the packaging. Not long after I noticed there were white spots all over the table top. It looked like the wax or seal had been dripped all over and left marks. I tried to remove it and it came off, leaving shiny/greasy looking smudges where the wax was. Very unimpressed. Contacted Wayfair and after a few back and forth conversations, they said they were unable to replace just the table top and had to replace the entire table. Fine. They wanted to pick up the original table when they delivered the replacement table beginning of January. Several times I told Wayfair I was not comfortable returning the table without knowing the quality of the replacement. I was assured it wouldn't happen again. Of course being skeptical, I did not return the table when the replacement was delivered early January. So present day... I opened the second box (which is no easy task given the size/weight of the table) only to find it is worse than the first. Large scratches on both ends, paint stain drips all over the table, a large protruding blemish (literally if tables could have zits) right in the center of the table. Very upset, shoved the table back in the box and emailed Wayfair with photos... no response. I called them yesterday and was told by the 1st customer service person that they would fully refund the table AND chairs, BUT I had to pay for shipping on the chairs. I refused. I specifically bought the chairs that are designed for the table. The fact that they cannot provide a quality table that matches the chairs should not come at a cost to me. Transferred to her Supervisor and was told the table wasn't an issue to return/refund, however they actually CAN'T return/refund the chairs and had so many excuses as to why. Because there was no packaging (I offered to package them, not allowed.) Because they were assembed (I offered to unassemble, not allowed.) Because they were past the ""30 day return window"" (unfortunately I couldn't see into the future and foresee poor quality tables being delivered). Excuse after excuse. Transferred to the Customer Care Manager, who was nice enough as I had a meltdown but by the sounds of it, has zero authority other than to read from a script (like the other customer service reps) and offer a 25% refund. 
I have been charged $1400+ for chairs that I specifically bought to match a set... a set that Wayfair sells... a set that cost MORE than buying the pieces individually... a set that was and still is backordered... and simply being repeatedly told by all of the Wayfair reps that I should try and sell them locally or find a table locally that matches and there's nothing they can do because of this and because of that. They are trying to pigeon-hole me into the fact that because the items were added to the cart separately (note... they were added to the same order and are on the same invoice), they aren't considered a ""set."" Like give me a break.
If I could call Kelly Clarkson myself, I would. She's putting her name on a product that twice now, the quality is so poor and the wholesaler of her product has now ripped me off of over $1400. 
Of course there's more detail involved but believe it or not, this is the short version. I wish your experiences to be better but if you're reading this, I can only assume we're in the same boat... and I feel for you. I will continue posting my experience everywhere I can and sharing with every single person I know and maybe there's someone at Wayfair with a basic understanding of human principal... but we'll see."
Wayfair Canada,2021-01-12T04:55:09+00:00,2,"Better not...

I have bought a few items from Wayfair now...one being a media tv stand for my bedroom, and the other being a white office desk. 

The Media tv stand was such a cute piece that looks elegant and was very simple to put together (this is the only reason I'm giving Wayfair 2 stars).

The white desk I ordered on the other hand, not so much. It came approx 6 weeks late (which I understand with Covid delays) BUT when I finally received it, it was brought to my front door in a cardboard box that was completely broken, banged up and half opened with holes in it. You could genuinely see my desk peaking out before I even opened it. It looked like this box had been ran over by a truck. When I did open it, the desk had numerous marks on it, with the desk top being completely cracked and ruined on one side. The photos of this desk online were EXTREMELY misleading...the desk was much smaller then marketed online, and extremely poor quality, which was not at all what I had previously read on their website. They did issue me a complete refund which I was appreciative of, however I was unable to make a review online after the desk was refunded (I can imagine this was because I returned it and they are trying to minimize the amount of negative reviews on their product, which isn't right or accurate). 

The only saving grace was the lovely customer service representative who was very kind, helpful and a joy to speak to.

Overall, I was extremely disappointed by this experience and would say it's definitely better to not shop at Wayfair."
Wayfair Canada,2021-01-11T23:24:44+00:00,1,"I will no longer be ordering from Wayfair until they go back to providing a price adjustment. My latest order was the last straw. We’ve been looking at a coffee table for a couple months, with no changes to the price. We finally ordered it, and less than 24 hrs later it dropped $20 in price! There’s also no option to cancel the order, no matter how soon you try, I see this as a common complaint now. They tell you it’s “preparing for shipment” and it can’t be stopped, yet it’ll be days until it actually ships. This just forces you to follow through with the order, and if you want to return it, it’s at your expense, which would likely defeat any savings if you are to reorder at the lower price. I’ve tried to cancel 2 orders the following day and both cancellations were denied, there’s no reason with computer technology today the order couldn’t be stopped, it doesn’t seem to be a problem to cancel online orders elsewhere. Customer service reps may be friendly themselves, but have no solution, you just get the same spiel. Even Amazon will adjust item price drops if you contact customer service, they’ve done it for me. Good riddance Wayfair, you’re not worth the frustration, I won’t be back!"

Wayfair Canada,2021-01-07T16:40:39+00:00,1,My first time deal with the Wayfair.ca online company and already received the worse service. Order placed within 24 hours and then found the price dropped on its own website. The company telling me they do not offer price adjustment so is my bad. And welcoming me to return the item if wished but I have to pay for the return. What kind of company is this? Today online business should focus on service but this company is giving up the chance to hold a new customer but instead no respect for what you are feeling. It feels really BAD when someone making you feel foolish!  NO RECOMMEND TO  wayfair.ca  nor wayfair.com 1 STAR!

They responded 2 days later telling me cancelation was impossible even though their website said no transaction had been completed yet (Then why offer the option?). All they have done is make sure I will never shop with them again and only offer poor comments to anyone I talk to.

I should have known better my daughter stopped ordering things from them due to repeated delivery of damaged goods."

Ordered back in August and keeps getting lost in their Kentucky distribution center. We keep calling and they keep reordering.  Maybe 4th time around will be lucky.  Unfortunately we want the product we ordered so still hanging in there, however we will never place another order with this company.
It’s at a point now where it’s comical.  Not sure how they can stay in business losing all their orders.
Do yourself a favor and don’t order from this company unless you enjoy getting jacked around."

I was informed I would receive it today, only to find out it shipped from Ontario. I tried to cancel after problem with first order, but they said it had been processed already, but I can send it back for refund. This is not likely to end well.

Had the same issues with other reviewers here. I was fooled by the professional looking pictures on their website so I placed an order then next day price went down and they don't match it. I cancelled but they said its already shipped. Later found out the product was damaged during shipment and they will send another one. ITS ALL LIES.

Don't believe the good reviews on their site, most of them are handpicked and fake. Trust me and save yourself a headache. Search wayfair reviews online and you decide."

I will NEVER order from this company again.
Wayfair Canada,2020-12-29T01:06:43+00:00,1,"I strongly consider canceling my membership with Wayfair. The main reason is that their prices are constantly, even when on sale,  higher than Amazon regular prices for the same product. The idea of increasing manufacture suggested price and then reducing it is a bad for business idea.  I don’t know what is the policy behind that, but definitely is not a good policy. I wish somebody in the management team will notice that."

These days, I saw many many Wayfair ads, so decided to give a try and bought a small table.

Man/woman.. this is one cheap furniture. I thought IKEA made cheap furnitures, but this is cheapness is in another level.. I would never ever consider to purchase anything from Wayfair from now on. In terms of price, I think they are not even that cheap compared to IKEA for since I paid $200 for a really small table that I cannot even use for an office setup (maybe it could be a good makeup table)"

Im now being told the supplier sold the remaining bed for $1600 and refunded my black Friday $550. Dont order from this place. Its a scam and you will regret it."
Wayfair Canada,2020-12-24T14:06:38+00:00,1,"I want you all to know that Wayfair is a total scam when it comes to reviews, read them and absorb them with a grain of salt. 
This is a legit company, yes. They sell products available in other retailers, yes. Are the pricing generally better than those other retailers? Sometimes.  
BUT they don't actually have anyway of vetting their products or initiating any sort of quality control. 
Here is my experience: 
I purchased 3 rugs all from the same brand to place in one room. Hillsby Grey Area Rug. If you look at the reviews, there are 10781 reviews as of Dec 23, 2020... and average to 4.7 stars. 
I received the runner first. It wasn't straight. It was going in my kitchen, and against the straight cabinetry was very obvious. I thought ok no problem this happens, requested a replacement. 
I then received the round rug second, going under our breakfast table. It was a perfect circle. YAY. However, the threads were coming off the stitching was coming off around the rugs. Requested a replacement, 2/3 maybe its bad luck?
The replacements came in. If possible, they were even worse than the original. The runner wasn't straight on BOTH ends this time. The circle rug wasn't even a circle. 
I was fed up and just requested a refund for the runner. The circle rug matched our table perfectly so I wanted to give it another shot- requested a THIRD replacement. 
Omg. The third replacement wouldn't even stay on the ground from how warped it was. Just folded upward. 
In the meantime, I still haven't received my largest 7x10 rug that would go in our living space. 
It arrived. 
It had 3/4 sides not straight, not one corner had a right angle. I tried hiding it. Nothing can hide it. 

I contacted wayfair. I was pissed off. They wanted to charge me a total of $70 to ship the 2 rugs back. Which in their words ""were not defective, just tightly woven"". I refused. After a slight argument, they issued me a full refund and told me to discard the rugs.
How dare you say that rugs that don't hold their shape are not defective? Why are all the pictures on your Wayfair site perfect? Why are they all straight? Why am I getting all the misshapen products? 
Anyways, I wanted to go on after to leave a review so that other people could know that this supplier is crap. Not one of the 6 rugs that came in was ""good"" in anyway.
AND GUESS WHAT? I CAN'T LEAVE A REVIEW BECAUSE THEY ISSUED ME A REFUND.
This was mind blowing to me. That means only people who KEEP the products can leave reviews. And why would someone keep a defective product? They don't. That is their sneaky way of getting crazy high reviews on their products. Only those customers that get the PERFECT product...the product as advertised can actually leave a review! 
Say its bad luck, but 6 rugs shipped to the same person for an item that has 10,000+ reviews rating at 4.7 stars doesn't make any sense. I would have to be the unluckiest person in the world... but it all makes sense now the reviews are rigged."
Wayfair Canada,2020-12-22T15:04:58+00:00,1,"I placed my Wayfair order Nov 26 for a mattress at regular price less 5%, total $289 plus tax. As of Dec 21 delivery was still pending.  Between Covid and Christmas that was not too surprising. However, on that date the exact same mattress was listed on their site as $679 price slashed to $259. Strange math indeed. How did regular price jump from $309 to $679 and down to $259 all while delivery was pending on my order?  
You would think that Wayfair would at least price match their own site, especially on orders with delivery pending. They most definitely do not. To price match I will have to return the order and reorder it.  The return will be free, they say. Stay tuned. Ridiculous"

Their website says all open box item checked before shipping to make sure all parts are there and are in good condition.  Received the desk very quickly and open the box right away.  What I discovered is a box full of badly damaged parts and thousand of shards of glass.  The large pieces had been removed and what was left was an absolute mess.  I called wayfair and they promptly reversed the charges.  They told me I had to hold it for 2 weeks while the warehouse decided if they wanted it back.  I told them to pick it up within 3 days or I would dispose of it.  I have a dog and a box of broken glass is a disaster waiting to happen.  I cleaned up all the parts with the intention of donating it but the panels were all damaged due to broken glass so it is going to dump.  Extremely disappointed in Wayfair and will not order again

Wayfair Canada,2020-12-18T19:04:25+00:00,5,"Idk how Wayfair has such bad reviews. Some people are on here complaining that Wayfair sucks bc they bought an item and the next day it went on sale and Wayfair didn’t pay them the difference of the sale price. Like, are you kidding me? Some customers are the scam artists, not the company.

I’ve ordered several things from them. One thing was three days late arriving so I called customer service. They were very kind and offered to send me the item again since the original one might’ve gotten lost in the post. They told me that if I end up getting both, just donate or gift one; they don’t need it back. Usually everything is delivered early. Descriptions are accurate and quality it amazing."

Wayfair Canada,2020-12-16T20:51:29+00:00,2,"This was a somewhat stressful experience. First and foremost, my item took 3 weeks to arrive which isn't too bad at all. The bad thing is that I literally had no idea where it was at any point in time. I signed up for the text alerts and never got a text. I didn't even get an email that it had shipped until I emailed their customer service about how I noticed on the invoice it said ""shipped,"" but never got any notification. (They never responded to the email either, even though it says someone will respond in 1 business day). 

In addition, this is Wayfair Canada but they ship from the states and you can't get a tracking number from FedEx because it's an ""international"" delivery. Um. My package got delivered today and I had no idea it had even crossed the border because I never got a tracking number!  

I'm so glad my item arrived, and in good condition. But if no one was home when it was delivered, it definitely would have been sitting outside all day and probably would have been stolen. And I'd never know. I won't order from them again just because I don't think they know what they're doing on the customer service side of things. Be wary of this.

Edit: Two days later my Wayfair account still says ""tracking will become available to you later."" Like.... If your package actually did get stolen how would you even know?! What a  nightmare that would be for both employees and customer."

False advertising, broken promises, poor customer service. Of course when they did finally deliver the coupon (not a refund as they should have), all the sale prices were over, and company was no longer willing to honor the sale prices that had now expired. Hard to recommend this kind of company. Additionally, the product that I bought dropped over $40 in regular price (not sale price) and wayfair refused to do anything about that either (e.g., most companies offer price protection on regular priced products). In such a competitive landscape it is hard to recommend a company with this approach"

Way better options such as Amazon, Walmart, etc that at least when they make a mistake they stand behind it and make it right. I ordered a some lights on Nov 18th with an expected arrival date of November 26th. On December 3rd, I still hadn't received them, so looked further into the order and it still said Estimated Arrival Nov. 26th. I called and the first agent was very apologetic and offered either a refund or to re-order/re-send. I told them that this was a Christmas gift so a refund was not a good solution, and to please re-send. I got a new confirmation with an email that said I'm sorry, but we're going to make it right. The new estimated arrival date was December 10th, which was fine for me as long as I had them by Christmas. On December 7th I received an email that said we apologize, your item has been further delayed the new estimated arrival date is May 6th. ????? What? May 6th? That's right. I called back and was told the only thing they could do was offer a 10% off coupon for my next purchase. THERE WILL BE NO OTHER PURCHASES FROM WAYFAIR! EVER! Thanks Wayfair - keep your coupon.

I just put in another order so I can spend the 'credit' she put on my account (because she wouldn't put the refund back on my credit card). But what's even worse was the credit didn't show up on my account, (she didn't put it through) and now the product that I purchased to clear my account and get my credit, is 'out of stock', yet it wasn't when I wanted to order it over 4 weeks ago, but unfortunately I needed her to put the 'credit' towards my order. 
As soon as I receive this latest and last order (not sure when that will be - sigh) I will be cancelling the business account.

Wayfair Canada,2020-11-22T23:46:49+00:00,1,"I don't know why we gave Wayfair a second chance, but we did.  And again we were disappointed. previously a desk and chair for a teenager looked like it was made for an eight year old. 

If you want to buy cheap looking furniture and spend a lot of money on it, this is the place to buy from. You will also get the pleasure of assembling the furniture, being disappointed, disassembling, and paying $50 to return the the thing. Our recent coffee table purchase was very childish looking and cheap. Cheap as in very thin particle board, very thin glass, and flimsy drawers. The picture on the Wayfair website did not look like the real life assembled product. Yet Wayfair billed us $400.00. The product looked like it cost may $20.00 to make. 

Don't waste your money on Wayfair furniture."
Wayfair Canada,2020-11-22T05:15:14+00:00,1,Wayfair gave me a FedEx tracking number for my order and ask to wait 24-48 hours to view tracking info. Well it's been 10 days and the tracking number on FedEx website still can't be found.
Wayfair Canada,2020-11-21T14:24:47+00:00,1,"Purchased Vanity and Twin bed with Handy service. Told by handy that their service is unavailable in my area AFTER I had paid everything. Contacted Wayfair through multiple e-mails + phone calls. Told by wayfair to wait a week for full refund. However, weeks later still have not gotten anything.
Contacted them again today and was told to wait another week for their finance department to manually correct this.
Whoever said Wayfair Canada is excellent, you are WRONG!"
Wayfair Canada,2020-11-20T21:01:52+00:00,1,"If i could give a zero, I would!!! Wayfair is a fraud. They are misleading the customers. They are white labelling items from other companies and putting additional price on top of it. All items that are on sale is NOT true as well. And the product specifications is a lie. I just recently purchased a heated blanket that i thought was on sale, only to find out that the item was procured from Hudson’s bay for 20 dollars less. I will NEVER EVER Buy from wayUNFAIR again and would tell all my friends about it."
Wayfair Canada,2020-11-19T13:52:19+00:00,1,Worst company ever
Wayfair Canada,2020-11-19T04:44:40+00:00,1,"I ordered a $500 desk from this company. When the package first arrived, there was a slight damage on piece #1. I emailed support and they immediately shipped out a replacement part which arrived very quickly. But this new piece was even more damaged than the original. I emailed again and another was shipped out. This time, the shipment didn't even get to me. It was stuck at the border due to missing paperwork, so I emailed support and they asked me to be patient. I waited and waited but no shipment came. Last week I checked the tracking status and the part was shipped to somewhere in KY so it never crossed the border into Canada. I emailed support about this and to-date no one has bothered to respond to me. This has been ongoing for over 6 weeks now, what a terrible experience! I would not recommend buying anything from this company, go to your local store instead. I would give 0 stars if I could."
Wayfair Canada,2020-11-18T20:38:05+00:00,5,"Wayfair Canada is beyond excellent!!!!
Great customer service with very fast shipping!!
Will definitely be my go-to online shopping in the future!!!"
Wayfair Canada,2020-11-18T19:45:18+00:00,1,I ordered a vanity on October 31 2020. Paid $3699.99.  Had a delivery question so went on line and notice the vanity price has dropped by $1300. I called and was told they do not price match.  The only way I could take advantage of the new price was to return the original order and pay shipping and restocking fees.  I could see a price change/sale of a couple hundred dollars but really!!!  What this tells me is the item was grossly overpriced. We shall see what kind of shape it’s in when it arrives. I will avoid buying from this company in the future.
Wayfair Canada,2020-11-17T21:17:59+00:00,3,The products I ordered arrived in a timely fashion and were exactly as described and decent quality. I ordered two cat scratch gyms and queen size bedding and a loveseat. My only turn off was some over eager fellow calling me from Wayfair saying how I needed him to lock in the price for the items I had in my in basket. I don’t want to be harassed when online shopping. If the price changes by the time I check out so be it.
Wayfair Canada,2020-11-17T21:03:54+00:00,1,"Overpriced for the quality but the main issue is that  fullfillment is unacceptable.  I ordered a table July 21, 2020 and delivery date has just been amended for the 6th time.  The current estimated arrival date is now December 23, 2020 and I have no confidence in this date.  I will be cancelling the order and, after three unsatisfactory experiences with Wayfair, I will not deal with them again.  I would not recommend Wayfair."
Wayfair Canada,2020-11-17T14:27:51+00:00,1,"We ordered a throw carpet, it arrive and was the wrong colour. We explained that to them and asked for a return shipping form. They charged us $16.00 to return a product that did not match their website for colour, we did contact them and told nothing could be done. Way-Unfair, you lost a customer for $16.00."
Wayfair Canada,2020-11-13T21:08:36+00:00,1,"I have placed order 3 times from wayfair and after placing the order within hours the price of the products went down and they don’t agree to match the price even when I have not received the delivery yet... and if I want to return the product they will deduct a return fee and credit the balance back!! they are just running a scam business, they are hell over priced and do not have any customer friendly policies..

If they continue operating like this, I am sure they will see new locks on the business doors soon.. Go for Structube or ikea for that matter they are the best! Hate wayfair, never buying again!!!"
Wayfair Canada,2020-11-13T17:45:24+00:00,1,"Wayfair more like Wayunfair.

BUYERS BEWARE - if tomorrow's price will be down, this company will not price match it's own sale price, even if you haven't received the product. If you want to cancel the order, you have to pay for shipping the item back. Please do not fall for the same scam that I did, this company should be out of business by now. Worth spending more same or more bucks at a competitor site that has customer service. Here is their response to my email for your reference:

Wayfair does not offer price matching because our prices may change to remain competitive. We want to provide the best price to our customers at any given time.

Although you are seeing a better price today, I am unable to extend this to your past order. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

If you receive your item and simply do not love it, you can return it within 30 days of receiving your delivery. You will be responsible for paying the return shipping costs to ship the item back to us."
Wayfair Canada,2020-11-13T15:34:36Z,1,"First and last time we buy anything at wayfair, the desk arrive in poor shape, corner broke, scratch everywhere"
Wayfair Canada,2020-11-13T14:18:10Z,1,"Didn't know where to enter the first time buyer code when placing order. 
Contacted them and they said they can't do anything. 
Offered another online coupon for future orders, which is useless. 
A day after I recieved my bunk bed, I found out they just dropped their price. 
I will be writing to them and try to get a price adjustment. Will come back and leave a good review if I get my discounts."
Wayfair Canada,2020-11-12T12:44:11Z,2,"I ordered a curtain rod for my wife. It was over $70 for the shipping was free. Periodic checking at the site revealed it seems to take about a week to prepare for shipment. Then another two weeks or so to arrive. Our problem is they deliver the wrong package. It was a grey blanket for a king size bed. I called customer service and told them what happened and ask them what to do next. The customer service lady was very polite, understanding however not particularly helpful. I know the item originated from Boston Massachusetts. From my understanding on what she told me packages for Canada are bulk shipped to somewhere in Ontario probably in the Toronto area and then packaged for canada-wide delivery. She told me there was likely a label mix up. She promptly ordered a new one. My problem is we need the rod now it's going through the whole slow boat to China Syndrome again. It looks like it'll be close to another month until it arrives and then we can only hope that is the correct package. I think since they made the mistake they should have fast FedEx the replacement. We have ordered other things from Wayfair and other than their super slow shipping haven't been too bad. I think after this we'll look for local alternatives or Amazon who are super dependable in the future. Lots of big promises in their advertising but they fall way short in the delivery."
Wayfair Canada,2020-11-11T11:42:00Z,1,"I ordered a shed from Wayfair but cancelled the order 20 minutes later through their website under my account because I found the shed for $300 cheaper elsewhere.  I had to select the reason for my cancellation etc. I did everything I was supposed to do but days later, when I checked to see the status of other items I ordered, I noticed they had shipped the shed!  When I contacted them they said they had no record of me cancelling the shed and that there was nothing they could do  so they charged me $149 to reroute the shipment. I am certain I canceled the order since I was concerned my credit card would be charged such a large amount.  They didn’t respond to my email messages when I provided feedback on this experience either.  Terrible company to deal with and so I will never do business with them again."
Wayfair Canada,2020-11-10T21:53:26Z,1,"My order was cancelled without my  knowledge and without any consultation or cancellation email. When we called back to rectify this error one of the items was then out of stock (it was not out of stock according to the website when it was originally ordered) and the replacement item offered not only cost more but it was also not an equal value to the item that I lost the opportunity to purchase. We were promised, at least, that the replacement would be offered at the same price as the item that was cancelled, but this was not indicated on the email receipt I received. I called customer support and I was told there was nothing they could do to lower the price. This was my first time ordering from Wayfair and this couldn't have been a more disappointing or frustrating experience. Nothing was done by any of the staff to correct the mistake that THEY made and in the end we're now paying more money for an inferior product. I will definitely never shop with Wayfair again and I will counsel everyone I know and everyone they know to follow suit."
Wayfair Canada,2020-11-08T06:48:04Z,1,"Don’t even want to leave one star, no delivery, they say it’s shipped, magically no tracking info available, I don’t know, I’ll see if credit card will give me my money back"
Wayfair Canada,2020-11-06T19:43:39Z,1,"I have had repeated problems with deliveries that do not arrive even before Covid occurred.  Most recently, I had to miss work waiting on 2 different occasions for an armoire to arrive but it did not.  I called customer service about the issue but it was never resolved.  This is no way to run a business and they do not even deserve a one star.  I will NEVER order from them again.  Dr. Ayalah Aylyn"
Wayfair Canada,2020-11-05T23:26:19Z,1,So sad I discovered an identical item over $400 cheaper after I ordered it from Wayfair. Had they offered a price adjustment (or even a partial adjustment) I may have kept the order. But they didn’t. On principle I am cancelling my order and I don’t care about the rerouting fee. Way fair has lost a customer and all the future customers which I may have recommended which I will no fully not recommend in using Wayfair.
Wayfair Canada,2020-11-05T13:04:12Z,1,"I purchased an Intex Pure Spa Plus for Wayfair. It was a 1,600$ item, the box arrived damaged and the tub was missing pieces. I contacted Wayfair customer support multiple times and received no response. I then contacted Intex to see if I could purchase the missing parts or get them under warranty replacement and I was told they do not cover any items sold by Wayfair as they are not an authorized retailer."
Wayfair Canada,2020-11-02T15:01:40Z,1,"Ordered a entertainment unit took 3 weeks to get it 4 pcs 1 was wrong 1 was damaged so I wait another 3 weeks for replacement then yaa the day arrived  ☹ one out of the 2 replacement pieces was damaged again so now I have to wait another 4 weeks o but they did give me a $42.00 credit big deal I want my stuff.

Update received my item for the third time broken again. Joke never again."
Wayfair Canada,2020-11-01T19:09:46Z,1,"Well I wanted to buy something but their website is useless. Wanted to apply for a Wayfair credit card. Kept saying would send confirmation email which I never received. Called customer service , was told they could not help me. Will never buy anything from this company even if it's 99% off."
Wayfair Canada,2020-10-31T02:49:55Z,1,"I too wished I had checked reviews before I order.  Normally I do, but my brain disease affects my memory now.

I purchased two manual recliners on Oct. 18th.  I received an email on Oct. 20th saying they had been shipped, but no tracking number.

I noticed on Oct. 23rd that the price had dropped by $130.00 per chair.  I called Wayfair and was told they do not price match (their agreement says they can revoke prices at any time).  I ended up getting a store credit for $100.00 (which I will never use).

I emailed the CEO, Niraj Shah, and Jean Oreste responded with two tracking numbers.  I checked the UPS site and they had left Ontario,CA on Oct. 20th and arrived at Erlanger, KY (which is where you can purchase returned items and closeouts in good condition) on Oct. 26th.

I checked my order for new tracking numbers and the number provided is invalid.

As of today, the price in now almost $200.00 less per chair.  I contacted the Competition Bureau of Canada.

Don't let them barrage you with delivery dates, get them investigated."
Wayfair Canada,2020-10-30T23:28:30Z,1,"Bogus tracking numbers that link to nothing!  Blaming Covid for their lack of service...funny how other providers (like Amazon) still manage to give & live up to accurate delivery dates.  Ordered a table, they sent the pedestal only!  Blamed it on customs.  They show item’s “back in stock” date, then as soon as you are two days away from their date they push it out another month!  They used to be so great; now they lie about everything!"
Wayfair Canada,2020-10-30T10:25:58Z,1,Purchase item October 19 paid for it it’s being shipped Wayfair Sent me  advertisement for the product on sale now. I contact them as it’s only been seven days and they refused to offer the credit even though I still do not have the product and it was less than a week! So as far as I’m concerned I’m going to return the  product and cut up their stupid credit card they sent me. “They do not honour price differences because things are constantly going on sale “ that’s what I was told! really within seven days and I don’t even have it whatever bad service!
Wayfair Canada,2020-10-29T18:37:39Z,1,"I had purchased a bed over the phone with a representative who had assured me my total was in canadian dollars because I knew it was coming from the states. This company ran my credit card for over 300$ more and claimed that the price I agreed to was in American. I knew I had asked twice on the order phonecall that it was in canadian dollars so I had asked the manager to review that phonecall. This woman Yevonne told me my phonecall was listened to by her personally nd others higher up and she said i was told on that phone call it was in us dollars! I have never heard a more blatant lie!!! And guess what- The company refuses to let me listen to that phone call and say that is not possible. Liars!!! Do not order items from Birch Lane (wayfair sister company that sold me the bed). Not only did they not honor the price posted on the site (clearly said CAD, and I provided them screen shot proof of this) but then to lie about the recorder phonecall is insane. I didn't even care about the bed or money at this point, I wanted them to understand that their sales people are lying or are just not educated on what they are doing so that it doesn't happen to someone else!! But this company straight up lied about what was on that recording and won't let me listen to cover their mistakes."
Wayfair Canada,2020-10-28T19:39:25Z,1,"I have ordered two beds from Wayfair. And I have received half a bed each time. Zero quality control on shipments, and they make it almost impossible to reach someone to rectify THEIR mistakes! They take your money upfront, then  ship you 1/3 to 1/2 of what you actually ordered. In my case, half a bed is 100% unusable. Ridiculous. They don't learn from their mistakes. The first time, someone else got half my shipment, and Wayfair asked ME to contact the other client and make arrangements to meet them myself and swap boxes... like this is somehow MY problem to solve. Ridiculous. Pathetic company."
Wayfair Canada,2020-10-28T16:49:25Z,1,I just finished a 15 minute call with the rudest customer service representative. The photos on the website are NOT at all like the product you will actually receive. If you do not check the customer photos you will get screwed. They offer ZERO reparations for making a mistake on their end.
Wayfair Canada,2020-10-24T20:14:37Z,1,"I had horrible experience with them! I ordered items over 5k, they arrived late and missing parts! So I had to pay my contractor to come back a second time to install the missing parts, not once, or twice, THREE times now they postponed delivering the missing parts! I emailed them several times, their agents never have an explanation, just excuses, I asked to speak to a supervisor, not one bothered to even respond to me! Save your money and order elsewhere where they value clients and you get what you paid for! NEVER AGAIN"
Wayfair Canada,2020-10-23T14:16:45Z,1,Terrible service! placed an order and attempted to cancel the order within 12 hours of placing it. Was told that the cancellation was being processed and will be confirmed by email within 24 hrs.  Did not receive cancellation email and attempted to do that again. The order ended up being shipped to my address and now they require i pay $50 return fee in order to send it back! do not use their service! total scam!
Wayfair Canada,2020-10-21T15:45:26Z,1,"I wish I have reviews this thread before dealing with wayfair. I bought a small item, waited for 30 days and still no information on where the item is. Every time I contact them they will ask me to give them more time to investigate. At first they said give us 3 days then they said 10 days then 20 days…"
Wayfair Canada,2020-10-20T15:08:25Z,1,"Wish I had seen this thread before I made my first purchase a few weeks ago. 

Stay a away!!! The UPS tracking number they provide doesn't even exist on UPS website. When I called them to find out where the product was because it should have been delivered today, they said, it just arrived at the consolidation center today in Etobicoke. That's like Toronto, an hour from my home, but their website doesn't show the updated tracking number. Then the guys says "" I think you'll see it by Friday, but if come Saturday you don't have the product, be sure to call us, it might mean that it's lost and we'll have to reorder the product."" Seriously? If you know it's arrived at the consolidation centre, how could it be lost? I call BS and would be willing to bet it won't be here Friday. When I ordered the two pillows, the description didn't say anything about being an international order, it said it was locally in stock!!!  After placing the order the invoice shows ""international delivery"". So you can bet it's likely coming from China.

This is seriously a BAD business."
Wayfair Canada,2020-10-17T15:01:41Z,1,"Wayfair is not an honest business. Stay away from them if you are not looking for a headache.  I purchased a shower enclosure from Wayfair on Spet. 01, 2020. The price was good but they couldn't deliver.  I was looking to receive the item but nothing happened even 45 days after they charged me. I called them and they told me that the item was lost in transition. I checked online information and other clients have reported a similar problem. If they can not deliver they just simply blame it on transition-related issues.  I canceled my order and I will never purchase anything from them."
Wayfair Canada,2020-10-15T00:24:06Z,1,They internally canceled our order with no explanation a week after we had purchased it. Don't hold your breath. Very disappointed with the lack of communication for such a large company.
Wayfair Canada,2020-10-14T18:13:18Z,2,"I brought a pair of bars stools for my new home. Wayfair sent me duplicate order and it's being so much stress for Wayfair to pickup this duplicate order. 
I am so disappointed in Wayfair service."
Wayfair Canada,2020-10-14T16:22:59Z,1,"Really surprised at how bad of an experience I had with wayfair! Definitely don't buy from here, inconsistent quality, they will arbitrarily cancel your order saying it was not a available and then relist at a higher price, customer service is very nice but absolutely useless. Stick with better quality elsewhere and double check the deals, they aren't actually as competitive as they seem to be. Super disappointed, I wanted to like you guys."
Wayfair Canada,2020-10-13T16:30:27Z,1,This place is Terrible they went and took order money out twice and they take new money every 5 days without even telling you if your order doesn’t ship never ordering from there ever again they don’t even deserve 1 star their products are garbage quality as well I have ordered here before and got package it was cracked and dented and they tell me my recent order was gonna ship for 3 different days and then it gets back ordered so I cancelled it and never ordering again
Wayfair Canada,2020-10-12T20:03:04Z,1,"I order a bedside table for my daughter's birthday, to be from her grandparents.  This was in Aug '20, and the site showed stock available.  A few weeks went bye, nothing arrived, the date on the Wayfair site said it was being delivered 'in the past'.  I called Wayfair, customer service was pleasant.  After getting my information and looking at the ETA (of the past) advised they were backordered and gave a new date.  Ok fine, I can accept that.  The next date came and went, and I placed another call in, similar discussion with exception was Customer service put me on hold and advised me they were contacting internal Wayfair resources ""saying they would pull the vendors skus since there appears to be an issue"".  I had some concerns but was assured this would be addressed and the delivery would happen - yep, given a new ETA.  You guessed it, that date came and went also.  I call into Wayfair, have the discussion on what has been going on.  Placed on hold again for an internal call.  Customer Service comes back and says “I spoke to the vendor they are receiving a new shipment on Oct 12th and will deliver to you”.  We are in Ontario, Canada, Oct 12th is Thanksgiving.  I realize the call centre is in the USA, but the USA knows that even in their country it is one of the most recognized days of the calendar year.  I advised this was strike 3, and felt I was being lied to, not by Wayfair specifically but by there vendor.  Wayfair is the vendor to me.  Customer service advised they had placed a note and a Manager would call me…I have had numerous calls since, but never a Manager from Wayfair.  I had ordered a significant amount from Wayfair in the past 60 days, now, reverting to where it was before then  $0 going forward – you lost my trust, my respect and there are other online vendors that I believe would want to earn and keep a customer…bye bye Wayfair, oh and I will be in touch to delete all my personal data and opt out of any emails, post mail and any other information – just to save us both time in the future, and not waste our planets resources.  In closing it is very rare I would take the time to write a review unless it was positive.  This time I felt betrayed and lied to, so hopefully Wayfair (and potential customers)can look for any such patterns and make necessary choices."
Wayfair Canada,2020-10-12T18:59:45Z,1,DONT make an account. Wayfair won’t stop spamming you. Even wen you opt out. If you have the same problem forward the email to spam at fightspam.gc.ca and ask them to help stop this.
Wayfair Canada,2020-10-11T17:41:14Z,1,Ordered a bed and a month later got only the headboard. Another two months and many calls later only the center rail arrived and the rest of the bed became unavailable. Company is operated by the most incompetent people on the planet. Customer service tries to placate you but they ultimately couldn’t get it together.
Wayfair Canada,2020-10-09T02:57:08Z,1,Even 1 star is too much. My parcel was supposedly delivered today at noon. It’s 9 PM and NOT HERE!!!  Don’t waste your money folks!!!

Even with Covid I am not sure Wayfair is up to the task."
Wayfair Canada,2020-10-06T03:38:03Z,1,"They have great selection and customer service, but this is where the positives end.

I've ordered several things, the first order was cancelled without any indication as to why, the second one was put on hold for days again with no explanation so I ended up cancelling the order, the third one arrived on time but wasn't working (they did give me a full refund on the spot), and lastly, I ordered something and although tracking said it arrived - it didn't.
I'm not sure why I kept trying, probably because of the great selection, but they are not reliable, so if there is a time constraint or you need something in a timely manner, I would get it somewhere else."
Wayfair Canada,2020-10-05T20:17:54Z,1,"This company is horrible! By far one of the worst I've tried to order through. I had difficulty apply my finance  card and had to call Flexity (who had to call wayfair, to get a backdoor way to apply my card to account) finally after an hour on the phone it was added. Now a week and a half later I'm still trying to order 1 item and I'm getting authentication errors! I've called flexity and everything is good on their end, they suggest calling wayfair. I've now spoken with several reps (they only have sales reps or shipping clerks) and not one of them can help me. Oh but because it's my first order I can save 10%. Wow Is all I can say.

Wayfair Canada,2020-10-01T02:31:49Z,1,"Awful company! What a scam! I ordered a fire pit and it completely rusted 2 weeks later. They told me I could pick out a new fire pit, didn't matter what the cost was, and they would send me a new one. I picked one out and waited... and waited... still no fire pit. I called back today (over 3 months of waiting!!!) and they NOW tell me that they won't send me a new fire pit and will only issue me a refund. So, I went the full summer with no fire pit for absolutely NO reason at all. They refuse to honour what the first customer service person assured me and promised me. The customer service person today was incredibly rude and 100% unhelpful. How do you just go back on your word and not honour something that was promised by someone at your company?! Thanks Wayfair! Take your money somewhere else. It's not worth the hassle."

Wayfair Canada,2020-09-29T12:47:44Z,1,"Wish I had read the reviews here before ordering my office chair. My package arrived OPENED and the hardware pack (with all the screws) was missing. Without it, I couldn't assemble the chair obviously. I had to call in to order a replacement. I was told it'd take one week to deliver - fine.

A few days go by but the tracker hasn't updated. I called a few more times and was assured that it has been shipped on Sep 23 and I'd receive it on Sep 28. On Sep 29, the tracker finally updated to say it was picked up in California?!! I live in Ontario, Canada!!! I'm for sure not going to get it until mid-October.

AVOID WAYFAIR!! Their customer service is nice over the phone but they have no idea what they're talking about and they let their manufacturers run circles around them."
Wayfair Canada,2020-09-28T09:50:30Z,1,"Please read... two funny things happened. First off, they sell garbage items overpriced. I bought a desk for almost $500 and during the building process it wouldn't stay together I had to put so many extra screws in it to keep it up as it's made from pressed bored which is the cheapest recycled garbage wood that wouldn't even be sufficient for a camp fire BUT this cost $500 ? LOL Another funny story, I posted a 5 star review on their website and it was on the top of the list everyone could see, I let it linger for a day or so then went in and changed it to 1 star and added the proper review they deserved and guess what... I can not find the review ANYWHERE they removed it entirely LOL only want people to see the 5 star fake ratings hugh? Don't shop here, they will fall off the map soon enough."
Wayfair Canada,2020-09-28T00:45:35Z,1,"Worst company ever to order from. I ordered pillows and they never showed up. When i asked for my refund, they had refused. They steal peoples money. I was told that international shipping takes like we dont order from around the world. This company needs to improve or create the same shipping like Amazon does it. Worst worst nightmare experience ever. The customer service even hangup the phone on me when i was requesting for my refund."
Wayfair Canada,2020-09-25T16:21:25Z,1,"If I could give less than one star, I would. I ordered a bed and rails early June 2020.  Bed frame arrived and rails did not. After multiple phone calls with customer service (waiting on phone for over an hour) it is now September 25 and still no bed rails.  They will not refund my money nor are they able to ship bed rails. The rails are specific to the frame which is the issue. The only thing they have been able to do is send me a card from the founder apologizing for my experience and offering a $20 gift card for another purchase.  Terrible experience and customer service."
Wayfair Canada,2020-09-25T12:11:08Z,1,"very cheap vendor. try not to deal with them. they will call you and be nice to say that they want to work with you to setup business accounts. but when you want to buy something, there is no discounts. after you receive the goods, they offer discounts to everyone. then you ask price match. they refuse. this is just a waste of time. i won't do business with them."
Wayfair Canada,2020-09-24T19:23:36Z,1,"About 6 weeks after receiving my Billups Ergonomic Mesh Task Chair it began to squeak every time I moved. I sent an email to customer service and they automatically refunded $45 to my payment method without my knowledge or consent. When I told them I needed a fix for the squeak they said that since I accepted their money there was no other remedy, hire a contractor to fix it because 30 days had passed and that is the end of their obligation. It still squeaks, despite disassembling it and spraying with WD40. Note ZIPCODE DESIGNS is a Wayfair house brand of Wayfair and of inferior quality IMHO. I call WAY-NOT-FAIR, buyer beware."
Wayfair Canada,2020-09-24T17:51:50Z,1,"After waiting for 6 weeks for our bathtub, we called Wayfair as it was holding up our reno. We were told that they had no idea where it was but the would call in 3 days with more information. They didn't call back so after another week we called again. No apology for not getting back to us from the new associate but they informed us that the tub was no longer in stock. She could reorder it BUT IT WOULD BE 20 WEEKS before we would get it. This is the one and only time we will use Wayfair. Shady company beware!"
Wayfair Canada,2020-09-23T23:14:07Z,1,"Seriously terrible company. Bought item, still not delivered. Went to check on delivery and the item ordered is now half off. Called customer service, they said I have to order it again to get that price and pay to return the one already ordered. Screw them I'm returning their sh!t. Not ordering the item again. Never use this crap company."
Wayfair Canada,2020-09-23T15:56:30Z,1,"Multi Million dollar company will not give us some sort of discount since they MESSED up our order. Now we have to wait another few weeks for a missing piece. NEVER WILL ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN.

This is a HUGE inconvenience, I repeat I will NEVER order from them again. Also customer service lady was nice, however its better to order some smaller businesses that care about you."
Wayfair Canada,2020-09-22T14:59:05Z,1,"Do not buy anything from wayfair.ca, I have ordered backsplash Tile on wayfair.ca and repeatedly they have sent the wrong tiles.

They refused to provide more details as its their mistake. Never buying from them again."

Wayfair Canada,2020-09-18T20:11:27Z,4,"Initially, I was very angry as the bed frame I purchased end of April 2020 was falling apart.
I phoned Wayfair and it was the easiest resolution of my life. They refunded me immediately!!! 
I ordered a new heavy duty bed frame and hopefully it lasts. Bed arriving in few days."
Wayfair Canada,2020-09-16T22:48:51Z,1,"Awful online buying experience. The worst I've ever had. Purchased rug August 20, 2020 and quickly received a delivery date of August 28th. Then was sent a delivery date of August 26th. Called the afternoon of the 28th and was told that I could expect a delivery either September 3rd or 4th. Called the afternoon of the 4th and was told that my purchase went to a warehouse that did not have it in-stock and he switched it to warehouse that did have them in-stock and that my order should have never even gone to the first warehouse. Tuesday, September 8th I checked my account and there was finally tracking info and had a delivery date of Tuesday, September 8th. I checked my account early afternoon on the 8th only to see that it said ""Delivered"" and that it was delivered to Cranbury, NJ signed by ELOPEZ. I am not ELOPEZ and I live in Ontario, Canada, not Cranbury, New Jersey. Needless to say, I called thinking my package was delivered to someone else only to find out that it is a Wayfair's warehouse. I was told that it should receive a tracking number and I would be able to follow my package. As of Friday, September 11 it still did not have a tracking number. I called again and spoke with Linda who told me it could take another 5-7 business days to receive tracking info. Linda said she would stay on it and on Tuesday when she was back at work would check into it and let me know but if I had any further questions I could call her and leave a message. Tuesday, September 15th came around and the carpet went on sale, $45 cheaper than what I originally paid. I called Linda, left a message asking if she had any further info about my purchase and if I could get a price adjustment. I never heard from her. As of this afternoon (Wednesday, September 16) and buy 6pm I decided enough is enough. Wayfair had my money and I had nothing to show for it not even a tracking number. So I cancelled my order. Waiting for an in-stock item for almost a month without any tracking info is ridiculous. It is quite apparent that Wayfair isn't equipped to deliver to Canada. As I was told by one of the customer service reps, sometimes there isn't even a tracking number sent once the item reaches there warehouse and is sent to Canada. Not one of the customer service reps could even find out why it was just sitting in the Wayfair warehouse in Cranbury, NJ since September 8th. Wayfair obviously has a huge logistics problem from purchase to delivery on both the website and staff programs. The customer service staff are very friendly but that's the only thing Wayfair has going for it.
Note: this was my first purchase from Wayfair."
Wayfair Canada,2020-09-14T16:45:28Z,1,"Ordered five items for over $1500.  Wayfair took the money from my account, but never shipped anything.  Order was placed ON HOLD due to a bug in their system and invoice indicated $0 payment received.  I'm out $1,500 and never received items.  It's been three days and I am still trying to get my money refunded.  So far they are ABSOLUTES THIEVES"
Wayfair Canada,2020-09-14T00:01:22Z,1,"I had called Wayfair to get a TV stand, all in white. the person on the phone said it was available and placed the order.  I waited and waited, no movement from FedEx. So i called back Wayfair and all of a sudden, the product all in white was out of stock.  I asked to speak with a manager, which i did.  She made a deal with me(by email, proof available), that if i order the white tv stand with black drawers, she would replace my drawers with white ones free of charge.  So i placed the new order and tried to reach her again for a week, no call backs, no replies.  I tried to escalate to another manager, totally ignored.  There is ABSOLUTELY no WAY to get what you want or get compensation for your time and money lost from them, they dont care!  No way to reach them or contact anyone higher than a manager."
Wayfair Canada,2020-09-11T22:02:20Z,1,"Customer service is not consistent ,shipping and tracking info non existent . price drop just after you order is processed. I am still waiting for several order's after I was advised they were shipped 2 months or so ago. Also they have my money with no info if I'm going to get the products at all, this is getting unacceptable and not a way to run a global business.  They should take a page out of Amazon's book when it comes to service."
Wayfair Canada,2020-09-09T23:27:12Z,1,"Beware false advertising.  Free shipping for over 50$.....is all over the site.  However, despite free shipping on a previous order only 2 months ago....now I am in a shipping tax area....so my almost 300$ order also has surprise shipping costs.  Spoke with Wayfair rep and got nowhere.   Never again"
Wayfair Canada,2020-09-08T20:29:35Z,1,"I bought a Payan Jumbo sofa almost a year ago. And seams got ripped apart and the upholstery got broken into pieces. Contacted wayafair, they advised to reach manufacturer who in turn told me to cantact Wayfair. Wayfair advised again to go a repair shop as I bought this on Jul 2019. this is insane! Never buy anything from this site. Almost $550 went down the drain."
Wayfair Canada,2020-09-07T07:58:50Z,1,Its good on price but quality is so damn cheap!! I bought two comforters from there it has not even been a month and comforter's thread is already coming out from all sides ! I regret my decision to buy here !!!
Wayfair Canada,2020-09-07T01:57:37Z,2,"A site to be avoided. Placed an order of about 800$. They advertised for a 25$ discount but was not applied. An email inquire as of why, was answered by a customer rep that sent a link to a very long list of excluded brands, which is nowhere to be found on the web site. On top of that the brand I was trying to purchase was not on the list. Luckily I was able to cancel the order. A site that stinks dishonesty! 1.6 rating is too good for them."
Wayfair Canada,2020-09-07T01:32:10Z,1,"Bought a couch for sale on the 2nd, three days later it's on sale at a deeper discount. I contact support asking if I could get the price difference credited (hasn't shipped yet), was told no. Okay fine. I try to cancel the order so I can reorder the cheaper price, but it's been ""pending cancellation"" all weekend and the sofa won't be on sale by time it's finally cancelled and I'm not interested in being charged twice. They're so slow with everything, once my refund is processed I will shop from another retailer, I can't be bothered with trying again with them. This was my first time using Wayfair and it's such a headache. 

Suggestions to Management: 1) Price match yourself, especially when the difference is well under a week. 2) Cancellations shouldn't take days. You're a large company with huge demand, you should have the infrastructure and personnel to accomodate that."
Wayfair Canada,2020-09-05T18:05:04Z,1,Ordered 2 End Tables. for $213.00 and 2 Days later (Just as it got shipped) It went on more Sale for 189.99. When Asked if they could refund me the difference they says No. I would need to Return the tables and order again at sale price.
Wayfair Canada,2020-09-01T23:58:03Z,1,"After reading the reviews we also had Wayfair tell us they lost our patio furniture in transit lol . We ordered the set over 45 days ago and now they offered to reorder the set again Or refund. We will be getting our refund and never order from this company again. 
Buyers beware !!
Terrible customer service"
Wayfair Canada,2020-08-31T21:25:53Z,4,"I have purchased from Wayfair numerous times and have usually been happy, but my recent purchase 4 days later was $70 cheaper and when I called to get price adjustment they wouldn’t. These guys are crooks! They said it was a sale and I haven’t even gotten my item yet!!! Do not shop here unless your willing to get the worse deal possible!

*UPDATE* 
I have to give more stars as I called again and the rep went above and beyond to resolve the issue for me and make it right! So while I still don’t agree with their price adjustment policy, they have made it better for me and I may continue to still shop with them."

extremely disapointed 
let alone that the quality of the set is very poor"
Wayfair Canada,2020-08-31T15:57:27Z,1,Be aware that waifair is charging your money and dont ship the items you purchased. I bought two items which stated delivery in 2 days. After a week of endless emails  they told me to cancel my orders!  Do NOT think that you can purchase from them. You might end up waiting for your items and then refund for weeks while they are keeping your$$$
Wayfair Canada,2020-08-28T22:58:54Z,1,Deck wicker sofa and table looked good but missing parts. Ordered parts and wrong pats sent out. 2 yrs almost to the day the wicker under the glass top table started to expand/contract and melt just  disintegrating the wicker top. Both Suntone and Wayfair would not replace the table top for free or for a charge. This is now going into the trash bin. I wouldn't touch Wayfair with a barge pole.
Wayfair Canada,2020-08-28T15:17:12Z,1,"Worst online shopping experience. They have a .ca address but ship from the US. Never provided a tracking number, spoke to 6 different reps who all copied and pasted the same response, and only after I pressed them for the 8th time did they investigate and realize my item was lost in transit. Never ordering from there again."
Wayfair Canada,2020-08-28T13:50:02Z,1,"Poor customer service and quality. 4 out of the 6 products I ordered arrived damaged, one is still on its way and I am not looking forward to seeing the quality on that. Most product is from Vietnam or Malaysia and made of poor quality materials that dont justify the premium prices. They refund you the money easily but you are left to dispose of the broken or damaged items on your own! I dont have the facilities to dispose of an item like a bed on my own!
Dining table arrived damaged and I am being told that it is normal finish!! Terrible. Will not buy again!"
Wayfair Canada,2020-08-26T20:22:11Z,5,I am an interior designer and builder and have used wayfair many times. I find they have a great choice of options at reasonable prices. Their customer service is amazing and they are very understanding if any issues arise. I highly recommend giving them a try. I usually never write reviews.
Wayfair Canada,2020-08-25T22:54:27Z,1,I did order several times.  After all their service started to get peculiar! My order still in back order for 4 months and now there telling me we’re out of stock and no refund .......
Wayfair Canada,2020-08-25T14:27:49Z,1,"Ordered chair in may and it kept getting delayed. By August I was losing my patience and with Covid and the US postal service asked for my money back and cancelled the chair. The whole experience was stressful and a complete waste of my time. I was happy to get my money back!
Don’t bother"
Wayfair Canada,2020-08-24T16:29:05Z,1,"Never again. They have items for sale which they don’t have stock of but don’t tell you that until after purchase. Then when you try to cancel, they ignore the cancellation and ship anyway, or at least claim it’s been shipped so you can’t cancel. Seriously crooked company."
Wayfair Canada,2020-08-21T19:15:55Z,1,"THE WORST SITE TO ORDER FROM ,, NEVER AGAIN"
Wayfair Canada,2020-08-17T17:02:10Z,1,"I will never order from these people again! Something I ordered was expected Aug 5, it's now Aug 17 and still no sign of it. I tried to cancel the order only to get an immediate email back saying it couldn't be cancelled because it was in production or has been shipped. Five minutes later I get an email confirming shipment with a tracking number, shipped by FedEx. The tracking number doesnt exist so they tell me it went by UPS, the tracking number shows the delivery was to New Jersey (I am not in New Jersey). Now they dont respond to my emails. I have contacted my credit card company to dispute the charge"
Wayfair Canada,2020-08-17T16:49:47Z,1,"I've almost never had a worse customer service experience. I ordered over the phone because the woman helping me said that this way she could request a specific delivery date. We weren't sure about one item and she said not to worry, we had 48 hours to cancel if we changed our minds. I cancelled one item about 12 hours later only to be told I couldn't cancel it. So I called FedEx myself and told them to send it back, they were great, no problems with FedEx. Unfortunately Wayfair thinks it's fair to charge me $120 restocking fee, even though their representative told me I could cancel it. Also, she had said the other items would be delivered after a certain date (we don't have possession of the house yet) but of course this was bull too and items arrived separately and before they were supposed to. After complaining about the unfairness of the $120 finally someone told me a manager would call me to make it right. But that turns out to be another lie as well. They will say anything, they literally just don't care."
Wayfair Canada,2020-08-15T14:19:44Z,1,"We recently ordered high back Lawn chair cushions from Wayfair. They advertised them as 47” when they arrived they were 44” long to short for the chairs. We returned them immediately and when we checked our billing these crooks charged us $16.00 to return them. I complained but got no results.
Don’t buy from Wayfair they are a ripoff company beware of surreptitious charges."
Wayfair Canada,2020-08-15T05:15:28Z,1,"I was very disappointed with one of my recent purchases, but unfortunately they didn’t post my negative review. The description says the item was solid wood, but when I received the pedestal, it is made of cheap plastic! On top of that, it went down in price 2 days after I received it, and I overpaid more than $40+ tax. Customer service refused to refund the difference offering 10% discount on my next purchase within a month. I would be very cautious about all the “positive “ reviews because apparently, they don’t post negative (and more accurate) ones"

Wayfair Canada,2020-08-13T03:55:10Z,1,"I ordered a Rain Wizard 42 Gallon Rock Rain Barrel on June  9th. The deliver date was supposed to be July 31st which I put down to COVID. When August rolled around I still hadn't received the barrel or any communication from Wayfair. I went into the site to check and noted the product showed as delivered. I've been home since March and no one from either Wayfair or FedEx had contacted me or left a notification they tried to deliver. I contacted Wayfair and they said the item had been returned as ""customer unavailable"". No one tried to deliver so I'm not sure how they determined that. Wayfair's response to resolving the situation was to order me another one at full price and have me wait till late October for delivery.  I called them to discuss as this is unacceptable. The person on the phone said he couldn't do anything to ""make things right"" and would have to escalate my complaint.  I was promised they would get back to me with respect to what they would or would not do to make things right.  They never did respond and when I contacted them again asking questions they did not answer the questions but instead reiterated that if I didn't want to wait another 11 weeks, they would cancel the order and refund my money.  How generous.  I'm not impressed with Wayfair and think they've really been slipping."
Wayfair Canada,2020-08-11T14:41:32Z,1,"Bought a dining table; it will take 2 months to deliver. One month in (so 1 month still to go until shipping!), we noticed a price drop on their website and asked Wayfair to match the new price. They refused! Why? I've never heard of this kind of practice before. Should I just cancel and re-order; what if it delays shipping by another month then? All this seems downright shady and I will not be purchasing from Wayfair in the future."
Wayfair Canada,2020-08-08T05:14:26Z,1,"I did not place an order. The app automatically placed the order of all the items in cart and even charge my credit card without asking my confirmation. I only knew that an order was placed because I received an email notification that an order was successful. In less than 5 minutes I immediately cancelled the order. 5 of the 6 items were cancelled except for one. Around afternoon of the following day, another email was received informing me that they are preparing the item for shipment. Since I don't want the item, I again emailed them not to send the item as I did not order it. It was delivered today. I emailed again asking for return and refund of my money. Now they are charging me for the return shipment of the item that I did not order! What a ridiculous practice. Is this a scam? Very bad customer service. All the response of the agent was automated. Never browse or shop at Wayfair. I dont trust the company."
Wayfair Canada,2020-08-05T14:23:36Z,1,"Wayfair = Trash

I’ve never written a review for any company before. I heard so many good things about wayfair but this has been my experience so far. I ordered this table set on May 7th. The estimated delivery was May 25th but being in the midst of Covid, I assumed it would be delayed until at least the beginning of June. I was correct, the estimated arrival date was changed to June 7th. Here we are, August 5th today and I still haven’t received my package. I’ve heard nothing from Wayfair it’s been radio silence. I contacted Fedex and they told me my package is still with Wayfair.....I contacted Wayfair at least 3-4 times and i received a response back saying I’ll hear from the case management in 1-3 days. It’s been 6 days now. I literally won’t even be surprised if I have to wait to hear back another month. I paid over $500 for this table set. Why am I still waiting? What a waste of my time."

Placed my order and after a month of it not being shipped I contacted customer service 5 times and managers 2 times and got told 7 different stories, even them laying the blame on the shipping company when the shipping company did not even have the item in their possession! Was constantly told my item will be shipped out that day or the next day and that never happened.  
Plus my card was charged 2 times for the 1 item I ordered! In the process of canceling my order but we will see how they can mess that up to! 
Wayfair is an absolute garbage company!"

When I emailed to say that this was my first order from Wayfair and I was very disappointed, they sent me an email back offering 10% off my next order. Wow! Sorry, there will not be a next order."
Wayfair Canada,2020-07-27T20:46:35Z,1,"I placed an order with Wayfair for a high end office chair. Paid for it on my credit card. Received an email confirmation with a scheduled delivery date. Then, as the delivery date approached, I received 3 separate emails each indicating that the delivery date would be delayed. So eventually, the date was pushed out 3 times with a total delay of about 2 weeks. This was annoying but was still ok. Then today, about 1.5 weeks away from the latest delivery date, out of the blue, I received an email and a refund indicating that my order was cancelled by Wayfair. I went online, viewed the ""my orders"" section and sure enough, the people at Wayfair arbitrarily canceled my confirmed order - no warning, no options ... just canceled it. I have sent customer service an email asking why they did this without any notice on a confirmed order. As an interesting coincidence, I received a promotional email from them again today promoting office chairs ;-) Ya right ... accept an order, accept my payment, confirm a delivery date, delay the delivery multiple times and then hang me out to dry. I say have a nice day and I commit to never purchasing anything from WayNOTfair again.

Update: A customer service representative from WayNOTfair contacted me, apologized for ""the situation"", did not apologize or explain why my order was arbitrarily canceled and was blaming the manufacturer for the delay. After explaining that my issue was not with the ""delay"" but that it was with WayNOTfair canceling my order without notice and without asking me, they offered me a 10% discount on future purchases. I declined and as noted, will not be purchasing from WayNOT fair in the future."
Wayfair Canada,2020-07-27T20:43:17Z,1,I ordered an Air Conditioner at the end of June because it had a convenient delivery date of July 8th. On July 10 it hadn’t arrived and the tracking number was not working so I called. I was told that they had no idea where it was and they can’t locate it. I asked them to cancel the order and provide a refund and I would just purchase one at the local store. I got my refund quickly. Fast forward to Saturday July 18th I come home to a huge air conditioner taking up my front porch. I’ve called twice and emailed 3 times only to be told I would need to be patient and they will pick it up when they can. I can not even use my front porch and they are not willing to help.
Wayfair Canada,2020-07-27T18:00:13Z,1,"Review of online shopping and delivery to Canada.
Ordered a Sofa. The delivery date was stated as July 21, then it was pushed to July 30. In fact, I got the Sofa delivered on July 25, Saturday morning, while I was out of town for the weekend. Without any notice. A sofa was left at the main entrance of the condo. Not just a small box. Had to ask a friend to help. Got a notice from my condo manager. Oficial reply from Wayfair is ""Since the item has been shipped and delivered there is nothing on our end that we can do"". Very helpful, thanks Wayfair!"
Wayfair Canada,2020-07-27T04:48:23Z,1,"HORRIBLE!!! We ordered an area rug on June 7th it was supposed to arrive June 17th never showed up no communication about why it was so delayed finally on July 24th we called and they admitted it was lost, got a refund. Would not reccomend at all just go in store and buy what you want!"
Wayfair Canada,2020-07-26T00:43:46Z,1,"Worst experience with an online company EVER. I've never even heard of a company with such terrible policies and procedures. After putting my card on file with one of their sales agent (who makes commission), my card was charged up to an extra $50,000 for items that I left in my cart that i clearly told the agent I was not ready to purchase. I did not receive any of these items, and many of the items I did purchase came in either broken, damaged, missing some pieces, or the wrong item. 

When I called their customer service to inquire about all the transactions on my card, and for the missing/damaged items, their support team said they would inquire about this and call me back. We had spent over 2 hours going line by line for the transactions and the items. Two weeks went by with no news. When I finally called back, the new agent told me there was nothing on file from my previous call and we had to go all over it again.  Once we went line by line again, the agent told me that we had to call our bank and deal with it from their end because their system showed no errors. They refused to refund me the unauthorized transactions, even after the agent told me he could see on their system that these transactions were not made by me - WITHOUT DOING AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE PREVIOUS CALLS/EMAILS/AGENT OR INTO THE DAMAGED GOODS. 

I have now spent a combination of over 10 hours with different Wayfair customer service agents and my bank - and still do not have my credit card cleared or my house furnished properly. This company is not doing its due diligence to protect its customers. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME - do not purchase from them."
Wayfair Canada,2020-07-24T20:04:40Z,1,"Wayfair provided my family with terrible service and took no responsibility for their errors. They left my grandmother who lives in a small apartment in an elderly home with a sofa with no legs and the completely wrong items!! Terrible service and offered no help. Took hours of being on hold until they told us they would provide my grandmother with what we ordered. Wayfair, please take better care of your customers. 😔"
Wayfair Canada,2020-07-24T03:51:46Z,1,"This is the most ridiculous company I have ever dealt with. The website stated that if I apply and use a Wayfair credit card then I will get a $25 rebate on my order, so I did. However, I did not see anywhere that says it has a $40 annual fee on the card but only found out after applied for it. Fine, I may use it for further purchase so let it be. When I placed the order, I used the new Wayfair credit card info and checkout. After the transaction is done, I haven't seen any rebate of $25 so I called up Wayfair to figure it out. They said that there is a hidden option 2 somewhere that needs to indicate I want to get the rebate. Seriously?? shouldn't it an automatic deduction when it detects that I am using their own credit card for the payment?? When I asked the customer service agent, they refuse to give me the $25 promo! What kind business is this... full of craps at every single steps. So I was charged $40 for the credit card while unable to benefit the $25 rebate. This company is totally a scammer!!!! NEVER buy anything at Wayfair or you PAY to get even more upset!!"
Wayfair Canada,2020-07-23T22:29:11Z,1,"placed and online order June 25th was told item would be delivered by July 17 2020. Called Wayfair July 21st as I had not received my order was told they could not locate my order as the tracking # was incorrect. Was sent an email saying they reordered for me without discussing with me and that the new delivery date would be October 2020. I called back right away after receiving this email. Spoke with another Customer Service Rep. who told me the tracking Number was correct and that my package should arrive the next day. Well after waiting two more days I called back again was on hold for over an hour to be told that Fedex had my parcel held in their warehouse in Florence Kentucky and that they could not call from Wayfair but as a customer I could call. I called Fedex gave them the tracking # I was given to be told that my package was sitting in the Wayfair warehouse in Kentucky. OMG!!! I called Wayfair back and spoke with another Rep. who apologized for the run around and said they would just reimburse me for the order. I asked if they could call the warehouse to inquire and I was told NO. No other explaination, I was then transferred to her manager Kiley A. ex276077 and she sounded like she was 10 years old and when I told her of the run around I was given and that I had spent at leat 5 hours on the phone with the Customer Service dept. all she said was ""well we can reimburse you if that helps"" Really!!!! wow you mean you will give me my money back for the package that never arrived? Wow! thanks. That is so big of you!!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I ORDER FROM WAYFAIR. i have ordered from OVERSTOCK.CA MUCH BETTER ti deal with!!!!."
Wayfair Canada,2020-07-23T19:35:53Z,1,"I received two Jolin Secretary Desk both arrived ""crushed"".  I was told a customer service supervisor would be in touch - so far not a word.

Wayfair Canada,2020-07-23T14:21:04Z,1,"Lousy company, currently the worst company I have ever seen. Cant even ship to the right address and holding my money before the item is confirmed has returned to them. What logic is this? you shipped to the wrong address and I don't even have the item, and yet you still hold my money? you should have refund the money on the first place"
Wayfair Canada,2020-07-21T00:00:58Z,1,"Ordered an item back mid June, and expected shipping date was 3 days later...GREAT...BUT then I get an email 2 days later telling me shipping would be now 4 weeks later. With all thats going on covid-wise I understand and am prepared to wait. Then 1 day before my order is to arrive I get an email saying 'Unfortunately, we’ve had to cancel an item from your order because it was unexpectedly discontinued. '.. um, so ok the item was supposed to arrive at my home next day and NOW you tell me its been discontinued??? And to make it worse they are still selling the same product online!!! I called customer service and told them this was a very important item for me to get by the expected date, and although I could have bought from somewhere else I decided to give them a try, even tho it was going to take a month longer to get. The rep was not concerned one bit and said he was also confused why it was still for sale. Said obviously a stocking error. Stocking error that wasn't corrected after an entire month of waiting??? I asked if he could help fix this? can you check if its in stock somewhere else, and can you maybe expidite shipping... he said..NO, NO, and NO. The fix he gave was that I could try ordering again, and maybe I'd get it this time... SERIOUSLY?!?! Like I would give you my business again! The issue is now the other place is sold out, and I can't get this anywhere else...why didn't they tell me 1 or 2 weeks ago, not the day before it was supposed to ship. This isn't a small company and they are primarily online sales, so I would expect they would have their shipping logistics sorted by now, Covid or not. We were looking at buying all our bathroom reno stuff from them too, but after reading all the other negative reviews (which I wish I did before) I will take my business elsewhere. Beware shopping with them like everyone else says. At least Amazon has reps that actually can help - these guys are no help at all."
Wayfair Canada,2020-07-15T23:38:11Z,1,"I ordered a sofa July 12 and received confirmation email that i will received my order on July 16....But they changed the delivery date to Sep 21 without informing me. I find it by chance when I went to double check my order. I searched and find a contact # not in their web. I called they excused and I asked them to cancel order because i need it July 16 as they promised not September 21.
waste time"
Wayfair Canada,2020-07-15T22:10:48Z,1,"Terrible terrible terrible delivery service, get a expected delivery date witch it’s all a lie, I don’t understand how Amazon can deliver next day and Wayfair takes weeks and weeks.

Wayfair Canada,2020-07-15T17:49:04Z,5,"I'm honestly just writing this to call out every impatient ***hole that has rated in the last few months here. EVERYONE is behind shipping and your delivery date is probably going to be late. EVERY shipping company is experiencing major delays. It's three days past your expected date? SUCK IT UP! There's so much going on in the world right now, I'm sorry but your furniture getting to you within a week is just not a high priority. Give your head a shake and be polite. You can't even begin to imagine how overwhelmed EVERY SINGLE COMPANY is with customer service issues right now. SO inconsiderate."
Wayfair Canada,2020-07-14T19:10:38Z,1,Worst customer service. I returned two nights stand last month even though I cancelled my order right after but they still shipped it. Now I'm waiting for my refunds. It's been a month now I haven't received my refunds. I called 5 times to customer service every time they said to wait. How long I have to wait for my refunds. I'm so frustrated now. Bad Company ever.
Wayfair Canada,2020-07-14T02:07:06Z,1,"Be aware that the 'get it by' date is complete fiction.  10 days past my 'get it by' date and my product didn't arrive, I tried to call customer service to cancel.  After being on hold for 30 minutes, I was told that despite them having  no idea where my order was, I was told it couldn't be cancelled because it was 'in transit'.  It arrived 2 weeks past due, after I found a local source, cheaper too! (which I should have done in the first place).  I had to pay to return the item. Do not purchase from this company.  Shop local."
Wayfair Canada,2020-07-12T20:05:16Z,1,"I would give it a zero. Right now, I heard Wayfair is under review everyone. If you heard why your furniture is so expensive but poor quality, you will NEVER order from them again. When I found out, I was literally sick to my stomach. Have you ever wondered why your furniture has names? I would leave you to figure all that out for yourselves. I suggest you all do research, inquire and really investigate Wayfair. Anytime you are ordering from an online furniture store again, please please please investigate the stores background first. Thanks for listening."
Wayfair Canada,2020-07-10T13:45:38Z,1,"This review is in regards to Order #2713923205 The delivery date was supposed to be July 8, 2020. It is now July 10, 2020 and the order was not delivered.  The website status of the order is still the same.  I have called several times, once the customer service person hung up on me when I said that I did not want to cancel my order. I have emailed, and got a canned response, I have reached out on Facebook...canned response.  Where is my order, when will it be delivered and why does your website not update with helpful information? I do not appreciate canned responses, I want to know when my order will be delivered. This is the first time that I have ordered from Wayfair, and so far I'm less than impressed to say the least.
I ordered and paid for my order in good faith, I expect the same respect from Wayfair, not the duck and jive routine that they give customers when they start asking where their orders are.
To say that Wayfair has terrible Customer Service would be true if there were any at all.  I want my order, and I will be contacting the Better Business Bureau."
Wayfair Canada,2020-07-10T13:45:14Z,1,"I had ordered a mattress from Wayfair on July 5, 2020. It was supposed to be delivered on Wednesday, July 8. Their carrier, UPS, received the mattress on that day, and didn't deliver it. Today is Friday, still no mattress. I called UPS twice, they assured me both times that the mattress was going to delivered the same day.
This morning I called Wayfair telling them that I have been sitting at home waiting for the delivery, not being able to leave the house at all for three days! There is no update on delivery status neither on Wayfair's website nor on their carrier's. 
Wayfair, this morning, was unable to get a delivery date from UPS, meaning I would have to sit by indefinitely until they decide to deliver the mattress. Since this is unacceptable I went ahead and cancelled the order altogether. Shortly thereafter I received an email from them stating that I had cancelled the extra protection plan I had purchased with the mattress, but not the entire order. I was furious, called them again to have them issue a refund for the entire order only to be billed almost 50$ for return shipping despite the fact that the mattress was never even delivered. If it wasn't delivered, I cannot ship it back, yet I am charged return shipping!
I spent another almost 2 hours!! on the phone with a rep that got it wrong a number of times trying to get away with not mentioning charges hoping I wouldn't notice. 
While I was talking to her I kept getting e-mails from Wayfair with the incorrect amounts of a so-called refund without recognizing that I didn't return anything  but just cancelled an order that I never even received.
In the end, I was assured that I will get the full refund and that this will be documented in a day or two. So now I'm waiting for an actual written confirmation and the refund.
This has been a most upsetting experience. I am now left without a mattress, with three days of thoroughly wasted time and frustration. 
I caution anyone to order anything from Wayfair."
Wayfair Canada,2020-07-10T12:11:41Z,1,"I bought a room divider for approx. $145 from Wayfair;  it was delivered, I liked it andmdecided to purchase another divider, but the product was out of stock on Wayfair's website.  By doing a simple Google search, I discovered the exact same product at Home Depot Canada for a total cost of about $95.00 with free shipping.  Customer Service at Wayfair refuses to acknowledge this 50% price price difference and refuses to do anything about the significant variance in price.  Even if they offered a credit note, I would be happy, but they offer absolutely NOTHING!...the customer service was very poor, not customer first/friendly, and had a parroted pat answer: ""Wayfair does not price match.""  While I have had some good experiences in purchases from Wayfair, I would recommend taking the time to always do Google searches.  This is not the first time I have had this experience with Wayfair."

I received a $ 2,350 dresser without the mirror, then they told me that the mirror (included in the picture when buying) was not included, and that was not available for sale through the site also.Of course I returned the purchase, but the biggest problem today is the seventeenth day I didn't get refund yet."

Ordered. 

  Now Wayfair says the lighting was lost in transit ? With whom and when, truthfully it was never shipped. 

 Still waiting since June 28 no delivery no date for delivery nothing.

Wayfair Canada,2020-07-06T21:48:44Z,1,"Purchased approx. $1900.00 worth of furniture from wayfair.
1. Entertainment Centre: Poorly built with press-wood. Some parts were scratched. Instructions were difficult to read and some of the parts to put it together (screws) were missing.
2. Bed: Head Board: Bottom was scratched really bad, approx. 2 inches from the floor.
3. Light scratches to the face of the Head board and foot board.
4. Night tables: Two: One night table had a corner snapped off of it.  Poorly built (Press-wood).
5. When delivered the two delivery guys were going to leave everything at the main doors to the apart and not carry it to buyers apartment.  Convinced them to carry everything to my disabled friends apartment.
Over all:
1. Very poor quality.
2. Damaged to everything I purchased on delivered.
3.Delivery customer service poor. Customer would of had to carry everything three floors without talking to delivery guys and explaining the person was disabled.

I spoke to customer service twice and they said there was nothing they could do.  Worst experience.  Never shop with Wayfair"
Wayfair Canada,2020-07-04T14:57:56Z,1,Extremely poor customer service. Better to go to a local furniture store. Price changes too frequently and no price adjustment offered even within 3 days.

Wayfair Canada,2020-07-03T22:48:52Z,3,"First customer issue I need to speak to someone about and can already see a problem.  Online customer service number for Canada quotes lines are open from 8 am to midnight, I placed a call at 5:30 central time and lines are closed 6 pm Eastern.  I can see by other recent customer complaints I will not likely receive satisfaction.  Ordered bedding that has not arrived yet, now 30% off, would like difference credited to my credit card. I work in retail returns, this is a simple fix, looks like Wayfair will stonewall.  Should not have to return and re-order nor lose money to return shipping/re-stocking fees.  Not the way to service customers, especially during global pandemic.  I'll try again tomorrow, wish me luck, I'm not optimistic.   

Update:  Spoke today with Gregory, could not price adjust but did go to the effort to track package and had it re-routed back to Wayfair.  Should receive full refund in 3-5 business days at which point I will re-order.  Wait times on hold are very long but end result leaves me happy enough.  Thanks Gregory, much appreciated."

Citing that the company don't have any facilties for disposal in Canada and I was told that I have to disposed it myself. How irresponsible!!! I have to pay for my disposal and they would not compensate me for it. I would advise not to purchase from this company. Smaller stores are even better then them. I would 0 start if I could.

I called customer service and they refused to credit me the difference. I am a frequent buyer of wayfair merchandise and was disgusted that they would not credit me the $80 difference. I am returning the bedding and re-ordering it at the lower price. I will not be cheated out of that kind of money.  $80 difference in only 1week is just unacceptable. Any other store would honour the new price.

A $1500 desk that arrived damaged despite seemingly good packaging. They say they will deliver the damaged part in 2 or 3 months, but glancing over the quality of the desk, I am really disappointed. The materials are cheap, the finish is poor; Ikea does better than that for half price or less. I will ask them to remove my account after I receive the replacement part. I really wish I could return this crap back to them for a refund, but repackaging this item is almost impossible. Order some large furniture items online and you will see why."

Wayfair Canada,2020-06-20T05:39:46Z,1,"Communication is terrible sometimes...it is a hit or miss....be careful, sometimes right after you order you will see a substantial price drop and they will not do anything about that.  For sure we get ripped off in Canada and wayfair is totally taking advantage of the fact we cant get most things here at a reasonable price.  the last thing i had to order, because I could not find elsewhere...was a good 200 cnd. more had I been able to drive to the states to get it.  So be careful.  You will have a hard time on this site doing any kind of price comparison because you will have never heard of most brands.  It is really too bad that Canada cannot effectively get product in this country without extreme added costs...people like wayfair capitalize on this. If only some Canadian company, not owned by china could compete..... maybe we would be in a better place here... So sad this country is so far behind....and more so in the last 5 years!  Wayfair and others recognize this, so we will pay a lot more for anything from there."

Wayfair refunded my money immediately and covered return shipping cost. The Agents I spoke with throughout the process were customer focused and extremely caring and helpful. They took the sting out of my disappointment and gave clear instructions for return process. Great customer service!!
Wayfair Canada,2020-06-19T23:45:04Z,1,"First order with them. Sent me the wrong product. It was also falsely advertised. The couch was not like in the photos. I am super frustrated because now I have to wait for them to come pick it up to return it, will have to buy a new couch elsewhere so we have somewhere to sit and wait up to 10 business days to get my money back...! So I will be out so much money before getting my refund. I am lucky I can afford it at the moment, but other people would be left without a couch/somewhere to sit for two weeks....I also called and was on hold for 1.5hrs the first time...our phone call dropped and I never got called back, had to call again and was on hold for another hour. Arranging this return took up my entire afternoon, I had to find someone to watch my young kids so I could deal with it all!!!"
Wayfair Canada,2020-06-19T19:04:05Z,1,"Beyond frustrated. Have ordered from Wayfair in the past, and had very good communications with their customer service via phone when a table arrived that was not the colour that I ordered. Other orders and shipments from Wayfair went okay, even during this Covid crisis.

I ordered a bar sink on March 31. Not an inexpensive unit, and very specific to our application so not easily replaced by a different unit now. I got a notification e.mail after I ordered that it had shipped, with an eta for Wed April 15, The tracking info was never updated to show who the carrier is or where the package was in transit. When it hadn't arrived by May 15 I called and waited at least 30 mins to speak to someone. She said ""oh, it looks like it was lost in transit"", I will re-order for you. I get a confirmation e.mail that it was re-ordered and shipped. No tracking info again, estimated date of delivery June 15. June 15 comes and goes. No sink. I called Wayfair yesterday. A recording tells me that due to high call volume the expected wait is over 60 minutes. 1 hour and 47 minutes later, I get to speak with someone. She tries to be helpful and figure out why I am not getting the tracking info, but there is no indication that the sink actually in transit, despite Wayfair's e.mail telling me it was shipped. I tell her that I need a sink now and would like a refund. Besides the sink is now listed at $50 less than when I initially tried to purchase it. She puts me on hold. The call gets dropped!!!!!!!! No attempt to call me back. No refund in my account. Tried to call back again in the afternoon. On hold 25 minutes. Call gets dropped again while I was on hold!!!! This morning I attempted to call again. A recording tells me that due to high call volume, the expected wait is over 90 minutes!!!! Seriously Wayfair? The Covid thing is for sure a curve ball for your business, but you've had 4 months to staff up and get your business humming again. I would like a refund, and feel I deserve one, but how much of my time should I have to invest to get it?"
Wayfair Canada,2020-06-19T13:26:45Z,2,"I first stared dealing with Wayfair as a manufacturer back in 2015. They were ok to work with, couldn't complain about the sales I received.
In 2016 placed my first order fro products and was pleased, after a couple of orders I started to have issues- poor quality, smells and damages. I must say they did respond and did what they could to help. These items were not expense under $150 items.

I since order patio furniture this is when my first problems started in I noticed the quality was poor- seams were splitting on the cushions. But I was past warranty and they did little help.

Last March I ordered a dining room set- after six months I noticed the chairs were starting to warp in the middle of cushions, the bench could not hold the weight of 2 adults before it started to warp. The table is terrible . Now I am stuck with a $2000 dining room set which sucks. I can't do anything but scarp it for junk!"
Wayfair Canada,2020-06-19T03:29:41Z,1,"If I could give no stars I would. Ordered an item which was received but was damaged upon receipt. Contacted Wayfair and was told they would order a replacement part. Received no fewer than 8 emails saying the shipment would arrive later than expected. Finally called to follow up and was told the item had arrived and was scheduled for delivery in 4 days. Delivery company attempted delivery but would not leave the item as there was  brokerage charge of $22.09 owing to get a part sent out to repair a brand new broken item. Needless to say I won’t be paying any fees for something I had no part in damaging. Wayfair can either cover the charges or I will be shipping the original item back to them at their expense. Horrible company to deal with in every way, save yourself the frustration and take your business elsewhere!"
Wayfair Canada,2020-06-18T23:39:57Z,1,"Ordered patio chairs from them, extremely great price so I bought 6 chair. After paying for them and waiting for email with delivery date I see an email saying they have cancelled my order because they dont have in stock. But I noticed that they upped their price on the chairs and didn't want to sell for the sale price. Terrible way to run a business. Never would I buy something from or try to again."
Wayfair Canada,2020-06-17T21:00:52Z,1,"Please don't be fooled by the quality(or lack thereof) of their products.  They're marketed very well (nice website, great photography, advertising, high pricing) -yes high prices give people the illusion you are purchasing well made products.
For the quality their products are outrageously priced. I have found several items elsewhere for close to one third to one half the price. Their products are just not well made in general.  Junk. My daughter bought a metal trundle bed for my granddaughter and the welding on it was so misaligned it couldn't be assembled.  They did send a replacement that went together but the workmanship is anything but good. Make sure you really do your research prior to purchasing here and expect to pay much more than the worth of the product"
Wayfair Canada,2020-06-16T18:58:27Z,1,"Avoid Wayfair!!! Ordered item in May and shows as shipped the next day. Did not receive another update or tracking number. Almost 3 weeks passes and expected delivery day comes and goes. Try calling a few times this week. Today after waiting on hold for over an hour I finally get through. Turns out UPS lost my shipment. After reading all the terrible reviews I realize this is not a one off! How does UPS lose so many Wayfair packages? Anyway, they ask if they can send me a replacement and I say sure. I’ve seen all the issues with people not getting their refund or being charged multiple times, I’d rather just get a replacement than go into that whole mess. I hang up. 2 minutes later I get a confirmation email... with an expected shipping date of August 15th and delivery date of August 31st. Like you’re kidding me right! Expected wait time is over 3 months from when I gave them my money for something advertised as taking less than 2 weeks for delivery. It’s a seasonal item too and we have short summers here in Canada. Don’t waste your time, effort or money. I won’t even bother calling back to sort it out because it will probably take 4 attempts and 2 hours. What a headache. Only thing I will say is that the customer service rep was extremely friendly l, so one star for that."
Wayfair Canada,2020-06-16T03:11:04Z,1,"Ordered a Patio Umbrella on May 9th. Shortly after, it said it was shipped although there was no actual tracking for it. Still no umbrella, can't get a hold of anyone at Wayfair despite trying to call 5 times and holding for over 2 hours, only to be disconnected. Tried email, only got a reply that we will ask the warehouse. Tried facebook messenger, got a couple of sporadic replies which then told me the product is out of stock and won't be back in until AUGUST. Why did I receive a shipping notification for a product that isn't in stock for another 3.5 months? No refund because I can't speak to anyone about it, took my money and never delivered."
Wayfair Canada,2020-06-15T15:02:35Z,5,"I put in an order for three separate orders Due to changes of mine

I was hesitating to pull the trigger on what to me is an expensive chair, but will now go ahead without any reservations.
Great experience!!!"
Wayfair Canada,2020-06-13T02:39:39Z,1,"Ordered a Crib on May 24th, which was received on 26th may.
Upon unpacking, found two items damaged. Contact Wayfair and they promise to send replacement parts which haven't received yet, passed two weeks.
Started to assemble the crib with remaining parts, found another two items damaged.
Since the crib was received damaged, Wayfair is not willing to return the item and asking to pay for return shipment."

Wayfair Canada,2020-06-10T18:03:25Z,1,"Do not order from Wayfair. CA. I did an order for patio shed, $1400 more than a month ago. Now, a month and 12 days later,  they said to me that I wont probally be able to get my product because is out of stock. They charged me the total amount of the product more than a month ago. It's that ok? I mean. For me it is totally disrespectful."

Just now put them on the bed, they have thin patches and like fine grease marks on them, also way too big I think it's a king size and as soon as I put on the fitted sheet all the stitching broke open from the elastic...a complete waste of money never will I but from them again... Yes I've tried calling to be told it's a 20 minute or more wait time."
Wayfair Canada,2020-06-06T20:21:18Z,1,Ordered chair from Wayfair. It was NOT as described. Made several calls to WF (3 calls lasting over 30 mins.each and then CUT OFF at 45 mins.  2 further calls lasting over 60 mins. and then CUT OFF AGAIN!).  I have sent several email messages as well to not avail.  Received call from WF and call was cut off half way through lst ring. Gave up and arranged for return. NOW they tell me that all return pick-ups are cancelled due to covid.;  not a problem delivering during covid!  Now they have my money and I still have a useless chair.  I will never deal with this company again nor recommend to anyone!!
Wayfair Canada,2020-06-05T23:19:14Z,1,"I ordered a jute rug May 15th. Estimated delivery may 20th. May 20th came and went- no problem-Covid is effecting a lot of things so I’ll be patient. It’s June 5th and my account says preparing for shipping STILL.
I have called 4 separate times and been on hold over an hour, once for almost two hours! One time it actually rang and then an automated message said they were having technical difficulty and hung up on me. I have ordered from Wayfair in the past and not had these issues. Any insight as to what is going on would be appreciated. Should I just cancel my order???"

Wayfair Canada,2020-06-03T22:19:03Z,1,"We ordered an outside sofa sectional this was difficult to track and estimate where it is and when it will arrive (due to dates being estimated, no actual tracking of movements like typical shipping tracking i.e. UPS, FedEx etc.).  We tried cancelling but got no response, after sending the second email they are going to stop it from shipping en route to their warehouse but charging $273.  We won't be buying from them again.  We received 4 items in the past, even when they were the wrong colour we still accepted and paid full price.  I don't recommend dealing with this company."

Asked for the piece I need and said they would send it out and I could expect it June 7th, I get the confirmation email then says June 17th to expect it. And today (June 3rd) I now am told I won’t get the piece until September 8th.... I will never buy again from them"
Wayfair Canada,2020-06-03T17:57:56Z,1,"How is there no zero stars option?  I feel dirty giving these crooks even 1 star.  I ordered an item for $106 on may 14th.  It is now June 3rd.  I have seen no item, no shipping notification and the best part?  They have taken $318 out of my bank account.  When I asked about this they claimed they were pending charges and would be refunded....  Well I have seen , no money, no product and no emails....  They literally robbed me.  I have contacted my bank to report the fraud and will possibly take legal action.   You need to shop elsewhere.  The people behind wayfair are criminals.  I have the proof right in front of me.   DO NOT SUPPORT THIS TYPE OF BUSINESS.  THEY ARE WHATS WRONG WITH THE WORLD.  TAKING ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE.  THEY NEED TO BE SHUT DOWN, THIS IS NO JOKE.  It was my first order ever from them and I have since canceled the item however as expected, have heard nothing....  I will get my money back."
Wayfair Canada,2020-06-03T17:39:36Z,2,"Last year I ordered a wooden swing for the front porch.  The delivery was excellent, however the swing was inferior workmanship.

How people can think they did a good job is just amazing."
Wayfair Canada,2020-06-03T15:50:11Z,1,"If I could leave a review of less than one star, I would. 
I looked for a KitchenAid Mixer for a long time and found the one I wanted on Wayfair.ca. Being on a tight budget, I couldn't just buy it at the higher prices, so I watched it for months, waiting for a price I could afford. LOW and behold, it came down to the most amazing deal I could have hoped for, so I jumped at the chance and bought it. Paid for it, got confirmation and when I could expect delivery. Well, yesterday I got an email from them saying they had to, oh, so regretfully, cancel my order due to it not being in stock. It was in stock as I was buying it, but somehow now there isn't one for me 3 days later.
If I had been offered the mixer at a later date at the same price, I would have accepted, but no such offer was made to me. Customer service followed with an email for 10% off another item, expiring in a few weeks. When I emailed customer service about how disrespectful it is to fail to honor a purchase it was suggested to me that I could purchase another mixer that just happened to be a couple of hundred dollars more. Gee? Can I really buy a more expensive item? that's so good of you Wayfair. I will never purchase anything from you again. On the day I received a cancer diagnosis for my son, it was such a pleasure to be slapped in the face by Wayfair.

Wayfair Canada,2020-06-02T22:11:48Z,1,"When I had initially called it said my wait time could be UP TO 55 minutes. I waited for 1 hour and 15 minutes before I was cut off and the call ended before I had even spoken to a representative. 

I called back immediately and was told my wait time could be UP TO 35 minutes. I waited on hold for 1 hour and 30 minutes before finally hanging up. 

I ordered a set of sheets on May 9th. On May 12 I received an email from Wayfair stating that my package had been shipped. The tracking information provided did not update until May 16th stating that a label had been created.

My package was supposed to be delivered today however according to the tracking information provided by Wayfair it has yet to be picked up by Purolator. 

I called Purolator before calling Wayfair and according to them, Wayfair has yet to give them my product. I am disappointed with both the shipping process of my items which seems to have been mishandled as well as the poor and absolutely non existent customer service I have received from Wayfair.

First and last time customer of Wayfair. And I’m out over $100"
Wayfair Canada,2020-06-02T00:50:06Z,1,"TERRIBLE!
I received 2 damaged boxes, each 3 weeks apart with an office storage unit that i needed. Yes, 6 weeks after ordering a unit I still have nothing useful, but TWO piles of broken wood, cardboard and styrofoam in my house that i have to bring to the dump, on my dime.
I will never order from Wayfair again. Anyone that cannot properly support sending items to Canada in decent condition is not a company that deserves my business. 
I am an avid online shopper. I am setting up an at home office since COVID has me working from home. My desk, chair, daughters desk, dresser have all arrived in great condition. Difference is that they were bought from other providers. I have bought a few things from Wayfair now, and to be honest the electric fireplace looked as though it should have been broken when i opened it. I know that the courier is responsible for the care of the package, but that is your responsibility to manage this Wayfair. I am su dissapointed after waiting for 2 separate shipments that I will never buy from Wayfair again. Nor will anyone that i know after sharing my story."
Wayfair Canada,2020-06-01T20:52:57Z,1,"So dissapointed.  I spent over $2,000 last year with Wayfair.  They were always great to respond to questions.  Easy to reach by phone or on line chat.  Now they have removed phone # from their site.  I found it finally through Google. 3 times I've waited on hold for over an hour and never got through.  This is unaceptable Wayfair.  I'm sure you're busy with everyone ordering online during covid - but you are making more money - hire more staff!.  Why can't I leave you a number to call me back instead of waiting on hold all day?  Youre customer service has gone from the best to the worst.  I can't even get through to you to demand my money back  The only email is to ""comment on our site"" well I have e-mailed my comments to you and asked for a call - twice - no response.  I'll give it a couple more days then I'll be talking to the BBB.  So dissapointed.."
Wayfair Canada,2020-06-01T16:27:54Z,1,"Honestly, they have no respect for their costumers. We ordered a rug two weeks ago, and they said it would be delivered four days after. Now our item is 10 days late, we have to call every time to ask about it, only to wait in line for half an hour and hear the out case is under ""investigation""!

They are awful guys, don't but anything from them. I am so frustrated with their attitude and their refusal to accept responsibility for their delay."
Wayfair Canada,2020-06-01T16:17:46Z,1,Order was placed on 13 May 2020 with Wayfair for patio furniture but  UPS tracking shows its held at their Brampton facility since 21 May. I have been tryin g to get in touch with Wayfair and UPS but  the time UPS attends the call after wait time of on an average 45 mins to one hour they just say that it will be delivered same day and then nothing happens. Wayfair has chosen vendors who are not good enough to complete the level of service expected by customers and this  definitely will discourage me buying from Wayfair again.
Wayfair Canada,2020-05-31T22:40:32Z,1,Honestly their customer service is so bad. I’ve been waiting over 4 weeks For a dumb swim Basketball set.  My last update was May 20. I haven’t heard any update and it’s impossible to track my package other than them saying that they will give an update in two days but that was last date it on May 20. I’ve waited on the phone twice for a combination of over three hours and never reaching a live person. They have no chat system. It’s completely terrible. This is the last thing I buy from Wayfair.
Wayfair Canada,2020-05-31T09:38:29Z,1,"They processed my Visa at $65 higher than what I processed in my cart and never emailed me a receipt or gave me an explanation.  They clearly removed my 10% off first customer coupon. Guess what first order will also be LAST order.   I can get no explanation for this illegal activity.  How can you charge a customer more than they have approved?????  No answer to my question. 

The product that arrived was very substandard.  I was immediately disappointed but returning large furniture after pulling it out of packaging is so difficult.  
They did grant me a refund for the pictures I showed them because it was so obviously a piece of garbage.   But even with the discount I feel sick every time I think about what I paid for the item.  

Also their “sales” are often NOT sales.  Be very, very wary of how much you pay. I’d definitely price check somewhere else first for the suggested retail price.  They over blow the price significantly.   They do not price match their  own price drops within a short time frame either.   I will never shop with this company again the product was very substandard and the price dropped $200 within days after I bought it and they would not price match.   I realize I got super ripped off for how much I paid."

It came with a lining (may be wood) vey thin and now is starting coming out. There are some cracks and scratches that make it look terrible. For a more than 700 dollars and no more than a year in use is not good quality. I should ad that I live by myself, no many visitors, always without shoes in the house. I don't see any reason for this outcome. I can't imagine how is going to look five years from now. I contacted them and they offer me 10% discount on my next shopping.

Wayfair Canada,2020-05-23T05:13:13Z,1,Do not ever order from Wayfair.ca.  You will have a nightmare of wrong product shipped then offering to send a new one out but I had to still keep the other item and if the supply company does not want it back then I am to donate ....items in pictures on site is not the items being shipped.  You will spend hours and hours on the phone to just return it and then no one comes by from UPS to pickup the return.  You contact Wayfair and they tell you that the shipping company tried 3 times and no answer.  That is a lie... I was always home and no one from UPS came.   Seriously this company is a complete mess.
Wayfair Canada,2020-05-22T06:37:48Z,2,"First and last order with Wayfair - way overpriced!!! Ordered 2 sets of Umbra hanging pots and when they arrived last week I searched online to buy another set and realized that if I had ordered directly from Umbra, I would have saved $16 per set. The item was supposedly on sale, but the original price listed on wayfair was $32 more than the Umbra site. I started to initiate a return and the refund was going to be $9.50 less than the price I paid, plus the money for return shipping. I made a polite complaint about the frustration with their pricing and to my surprise they refunded me the price difference ($32).

Today the second part of my order arrived. Again the item is really nice, but greatly overpriced. Price comparison between wayfair.ca and wayfair.com for the same item indicated that it cost $20USD ($29CAD) more to order from the Canadian website. Frustrated with the mark-ups, when they are listed/disguised as sale prices."

At 4pm on May 21 Fed Ex emailed me to say that delivery was expected May 26.  Called Fed Ex and they told me Wayfair just got them the package that day.  When I told them it was actually May 13 in California that they received it and it had made its way to Canada on May 18 yet, the manager said she was also aware they had it since monday the 18th in BC.  But that it was easier to lie to me and say they just received it.  I inquired with both Fed Ex and Wayfair to see if its possible that Fed Ex not get paid for this delivery by canceling the order or reordering it again but was told no.  I will simply not by from Wayfair again if they support and use such unethical delivery companies."
Wayfair Canada,2020-05-21T22:17:48Z,1,"Would give 0 stars if possible. Worst customer service ever. Directly on there site it says you can cancel items before they ship. We ordered something for my daughters bday and it was expected to come 2.5 months after ordering. We found the same thing on amazon which was better quality, cheaper and shipped within a week so naturally we wanted to go with that and cancel the wayfair order which had not shipped yet. We placed the order the day before canceling. So we send in the cancellation they wait 4 days to reply to us and say they can’t cancel because the item has shipped which is a lie since it wasn’t due for 2.5 months and we hadn’t received an email confirming it’s shipped until conveniently right after wayfair emailed us. Now they want us to spend 10$ shipping to return it when it arrives in 2.5 months which is absolutely unreal. Last time we ever use wayfair and I’ll be spreading the word every chance I get what a joke."
Wayfair Canada,2020-05-21T20:49:53Z,2,"Love everything on this website BUT we ordered a $1500 taxes in dining set for our new home, and it came on sale for $100 off two days after we ordered. I reached out to customer service via telephone and was told they cannot price adjust or even give us a credit to use on something else, which we were planning on purchasing a lot more to furnish our new home. Unfortunately, I will not be a returning customer 😢 fingers crossed our table is not damaged when it arrives."
Wayfair Canada,2020-05-21T17:10:20Z,1,"I waited the whole day for my shipment to arrive.  it didn't.  I called Fedex (which does the courier shipment for Wayfair) and they said they didn't pick up my shipment though the tracking number shows arrival today!  I contacted Wayfair, and they said that the item will be arriving at their warehouse location!  I told them that I cannot take the day off to wait for my shipment again as Fedex does not give a time window of arrival. I would like to cancel it!! Wayfair told me that they cannot cancel the shipment!  They said  I don't need to wait for Fedex!  I asked them how do they ensure that I can get my shipment since I live in an apartment building.  Are they just going to leave my shipment at the entrance to the apartment building and let anyone just take my stuff!!!  Also, I ordered 2 items and they are arriving on different days!
Wayfair response is so unreasonable.  They don't care if you received your shipment, they only care that your item is shipped and they get the money for it!!"
Wayfair Canada,2020-05-21T14:08:48Z,1,"Horrible, I ordered a 5 piece dining set. Only got the table had to file for missing parts. I was told I would get the chairs within a week of it. After a week I got another email saying that they would need an extra month to get the chairs. After a month I get another email saying they need 2 more weeks! I will never order from this company again.


update.. 2 more push backs on my ""replacement chairs"" making it 3 months past the original delivery date of 2 days. No refund or discounts offered after many conversations with the company"
Wayfair Canada,2020-05-21T13:12:33Z,1,"Horrible company. A coffee table was never delivered to me in full, one of the packages was missing. I ordered replacement parts which never came and Wayfair didn’t refund me. I ended up with no coffee table and with lost money. WILL NEVER ORDER AGAIN."
Wayfair Canada,2020-05-21T04:51:34Z,1,"I'd rather give them zero star!
They shipped a wrong item and they are not shipping me back the correct item. I will no longer use them!

I ordered two duvet cover sets and they are two different kinds. One was Tamiko Pintuck Duvet Cover and another was Akins Reversible Duvet Cover. They sent me two of the same kind, Reversible Duvet Cover, one king size and another double size. 

I complained and asked for replacement and they rejected by explaining what they shipped was correct item.

Before this order, my order was shipped in a box which has a big hole and taped over it. I mentioned about it and they apologized about it and I gave them the second change, and this was the result. It was a big disappointment, not because they sent me the wrong item, but they responded me that I received the correct item and they just cancelled my replacement order by themselves neglecting further investigation, which was bad customer service.

If your time is precious and don't want to waste your time on complaining and trying to get the correct item, I suggest you to look for what you need from somewhere else."
Wayfair Canada,2020-05-21T01:09:31Z,1,"I ordered a ottoman May 7 and it finally arrived today after being told it was arriving May 11,14,15,19 &20 when I opened the box it did not look the same as the picture on their website and the box's marked differently to what I ordered Apply to return and they will only return if I pay for ups absolutely crazy

They sent the wrong item and I have to pay to return I will not purchase from them again"
Wayfair Canada,2020-05-21T00:35:04Z,1,Been dealing with Wayfair for over a month now. I realize my item was delayed but I received 3 different excuses and no updates until I actually emailed them. This is my third time asking where my item is and I am not sure they know.
Wayfair Canada,2020-05-20T21:37:01Z,1,This company is a scam! Spent $1000 on two green houses ordered from Ontario Canada never showed up and when I contacted Paypal to complain not even a response from them just a refund. I needed those greenhouses so bad and missed out on other good ones cause I wasted my time with these guys. I'm very certain my items were not even shipped as they never provided actual tracking info. I'm reporting them to the Better Business Bureau!
Wayfair Canada,2020-05-20T16:32:44Z,1,"Don’t don’t don’t shop from here.  They will send you all the garbage they have stuck in their warehouses.  Talked to this so called specialist Roslyn W, she was very immature, unreasonable, unprofessional to deal with. Send her photos of the broken, damaged item but she still gave me excuses.  The box it came in is all damaged and I can’t find a box that size to replace it. Roslyn W,
insisted to find a box that big during Covid-19 and replace it.  She won’t refund my money unless I buy her a box and send it to her.  There is no place to get like that box.  Shame On you Wayfair for scamming people during covid-19."
Wayfair Canada,2020-05-20T15:39:37Z,1,"DO NOT BY ANY MEANS ORDER FROM HERE. Extremely poor service from a supposed reputable company. I’ve ordered two things that were supposed to arrive and they never have and it’s been a month now. Extremely pathetic service and would recommend anyone to spend their money on a service that actually respects their consumers. I will not be making the same mistake again and will be using other services than this one. Extremely disappointing. Save your money and your time with another service. If I could give 0 stars I would definitely, and even 0 seems a bit generous for this company."
Wayfair Canada,2020-05-19T20:02:17Z,1,"I bought a piece of wall art on February 9,2020 - it is May 19,2020 and still no product. They said it was lost in their warehouse in Kentucky 4 times and now it appears as the 5th one has been lost - how do you lose a 4 foot by 4 foot picture 5 times? I have been passed around from person to person - always being promised to fix the problem but still no resolve. Trying to be understanding with everything that is going on but it's ridiculous at this point. I won't be ordering again."
Wayfair Canada,2020-05-18T15:05:47Z,1,"These people suck!! Their customer service is non existent. Because of high volumes of calls is the thing you hear when you phone customer service. Spent 1 hr. waiting for help no answer. The product was promised on 2 dates. Both were missed. If I could give NO STARS I would. I promise this is the first time and the last time I will order anything at Wayfair again.
Then they use UPS which in my opinion is one of the worst companies for on time delivery. When I contacted them they have a handful of excuses as to why it wasn't delivered. BUT, they will try for tomorrow. If it doesn't come tomorrow I will be sending it back immediately.
PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME BUYING FROM WAYFAIR, SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL STORES IN YOUR COMMUNITY."
Wayfair Canada,2020-05-13T21:30:17Z,1,"I have placed an order a month and half ago and I still don't know where my product is, the status online doesn't change at all. I've called them many times and they have no idea what exactly is happening.
Aside from that, they double charged me and agents always tells me that it takes few days before refund shows up but it's been few weeks now.
THIS IS MY FIRST AND LAST ORDER WITH WAYFAIR. NEVER RECOMMENDS"
Wayfair Canada,2020-05-13T20:55:01Z,1,I bought a fire pit yesterday tues may 12th and couple hours after I paid I checked the same product and it was 20.00 cheaper . So I called customer service asked for a credit of 20.00... she said no they can not did it. I told her it’s only a couple of hours... she said yes the manufacturer do that all the time.iThats crazy the same day within a couple hours. But I also notice when I bought it it said the regular price was 729.00 and when I checked the price it had no regular price on it just it was 509.99 and I paid 529.99  so they also change prices I thought I was getting it I. Sale. This is fraud putting prices up in down all day. There is a compliance that they should be under. I will not buy from Wayfair again. There customer service could care less and not helpful.
Wayfair Canada,2020-05-12T18:10:41Z,2,"I've bought a few items from wayfair,  every item was easily broken or couldn't be properly put together because of poor quality."
Wayfair Canada,2020-05-11T21:16:17Z,1,They double charged me for an order and instead of telling me they made a mistake they made me contact my bank only to find out that they did refund me and it would take a few days to show up in my account. Could have saved me a lot of time. They don’t own up to their mistakes.
Wayfair Canada,2020-05-10T22:46:56Z,1,"Hit & Miss with quality of their products.  Anything that is of good value or is on trend is never in stock or expected to be in stock and is used to draw the shopper in to be sold a knock-off or a similar product.   You sign up for notices when a product may be in stock be sure to uncheck that box that says send me emails because by unsubscribing to those you’re also unsubscribing to updates about that product that you want.   I don’t feel the prices are that much better either.  Shop around if possible buy local, in the long run it will serve you better if there are issues and you’re have a problem with your purchase."
Wayfair Canada,2020-05-10T00:21:24Z,1,Their customer service is deplorable. They aren’t able to resolve their own IT issues and customer service don’t even read the email you send them with an issue before replying with a generic email that is totally unhelpful.
Wayfair Canada,2020-05-07T18:28:17Z,1,"Markup scam artists, pure and simple."
Wayfair Canada,2020-05-06T01:10:34Z,2,"Decent products but their dynamic pricing strategy is ridiculous and outright wrong! You can purchase  an item today for $165 and the next day the price nearly doubles. How is that legal? I have raised this issue with the company and their response is that this practice is necessary so they can give their customers the best price. Bullish*t. Some customers benefit while others pay A LOT more than they need to. Shop elsewhere. Buy from local businesses, whenever possible."
Wayfair Canada,2020-05-03T05:09:02Z,5,"I love wayfair.  If something is wrong with your order, they send in another order for free and are fair with refunds.  Items come fast too or when they estimate it will arrive.  Love dealing with them and love the items I've ordered so far.  Great company."
Wayfair Canada,2020-05-01T20:21:07Z,1,Prices are much higher than local or other online sellers. I don't know why people buy from them.
Wayfair Canada,2020-04-30T20:51:36Z,2,Man! I was hopeful of this site/store. But I’m batting 0 for 3. Will never be fooled by these guys again. Customer service has been excellent 75% of the time. We have had to make a few jingles to the Wayfair theme about how crappy the company is to keep our sanity in regards to the BS we keep getting dealt.
Wayfair Canada,2020-04-30T09:40:26Z,1,"Awful organization. They let you buy a product claiming availability, but then advise you several days later that product is not in stock. In the meantime, they collect payment upon placing order. Won't even bother with this firm in future. Disgusting practice."
Wayfair Canada,2020-04-30T02:01:47Z,4,"So we bought a new build home and waited 3 years for it to be finished. 
Thank god for Wayfair and it amazing associate Daniel Stievenart.
We just moved in and He truly has made shopping with wayfair easy, and I couldn’t be more happier with the amazing products and professionalism we have received. At the extra bonus was how fast things were delivered...
 I will always put Wayfair as my go to for all my needs. 
Thank You Daniel and Wayfair"
Wayfair Canada,2020-04-24T23:59:49Z,1,"My experience purchasing here has been one of pure frustration. They held onto a few thousand dollars of mine from a cancelled order and they still have it, and I have tried numerous times to get through and spent many hours on the phone, and am unable to get through to customer service. My goods updated deliver time was many days after the promised date, and the professional membership is definitely not worth the extra wait time, as the savings comparison is almost nil."
Wayfair Canada,2020-04-24T14:00:01Z,2,Be careful when you order things... They tend to have a photo of a product and then it's not even the correct product you are ordering. Example: they show a 3 level bunkbed but it's actually a standard bunkbed. I'm pretty sure this is called FALSE ADVERTISING!!!! the quality of the product is very cheap as well. I loved the site at first until I started receiving my items. Very shady and not an honest company. Make sure you read everything regarding the product. I ordered bedding as well and they sent me just a set of sheets. Almost every product I ordered has arrived with scuffs or some form of damage as well.
Wayfair Canada,2020-04-24T01:15:26Z,3,"Placed the order and got an email that I will have my furniture in 7 days. Shortly after, I got an email that the delivery date was delayed for 3 days. After few days, on their site there was no tracking number and it was saying another day late (expected 11 days total). As there was still no tracking number on my account, about 5-6 days after I placed the order, I called them and they said that my package in US on the way to me and I will have it by the initial delivery date (10 days). When that day came (10 days later) and nothing showed up, I called them again. And surprise, they said they have no clue where my package is as ""Fedex didn't gave them any tracking info"", which is a big fat lie as you get the tracking info as soon as you provide shipping details to Fedex. Next day, surprise again, tracking number appeared in my account and the shipping information was just provided to Fedex that day (11 days after I placed my order). Of course the new delivery date was adjusted to another 3 days later. After another 2 days the delivery date was again adjusted to another 4 days later. So far I haven't received my order as of now, and latest update shows that I may receive my order after 18 days since I placed my order (I still doubt even this date)... No email or any other updates after the first 2 emails mentioned above. Conclusion: Wayfair.ca is Over promising and Under delivering! I will not buy again from them. Stay away!

Update: I received finally my order (around the last expected date), but it had some damages, so they replaced my whole unit, which was very quick. For this I have changed my rating from 1 star to 3 stars and I will give them another chance."
Wayfair Canada,2020-04-23T15:46:49Z,1,I started to order a coffee table and it says this order is eligible for free shipping. When i finished the order they charged me $50 for shipping! I ask why and they said in my postal code its not for free! That is misleading!!!! They could keep their stuff!
Wayfair Canada,2020-04-22T15:48:08Z,1,"Doesnt ship from canada, only from the US, they really shouldnt mislead customers with their .ca domain"
Wayfair Canada,2020-04-19T15:07:34Z,1,"The sku C002054046 ad is totally misleading. It said VitPaneles 70s wave 27’Lx24”w 

Cad $31.99 cad $254.99 87% off

When you go to the size option, then it will say 12”Lx24”W is $31.99 and 324”L x24W will be $409.99. 

It won’t make any sense that a  12”Lx24”W sample cost $253.99. Don’t mislead the customers."
Wayfair Canada,2020-04-18T19:46:23Z,2,"Please read shipping policy, even though everywhere on their Canadian site they state ""free shipping"" it is only free in the U.S.  When you contact then a few weeks later to track down the package which hasn't arrived yet, they give you the shipper's phone number and suggest you call them to see if they have your package.  Will not buy from them again."
Wayfair Canada,2020-04-17T20:39:58Z,1,"I have brought items from Wayfair in the last 4 years. However I did want to look at some runners. Last week I noticed that Wayfair has upped there prices in the last few weeks. 
WHAT A TERRABLE THING TO DO WHEN WE ARE IN THIS WORLD WIDE CRISIS, WITH MANY DYING, LITTLE MONEY AND FOOD COMING IN. SHAME, SHAME ON YOU."
Wayfair Canada,2020-04-16T20:52:37Z,4,"I’ve ordered several items in the last few weeks including:
-King canopy bed frame (that was a total steal on sale at $375!)
-set of two velvet desk chairs ($185)
-velvet sleeper sofa ($1350)
-living room rug ($400)

I’ve found the prices to be great and the quality to be in alignment with the price points, and in some cases to exceed expectations. We’ve only had these items for about a month now so the long-term quality is yet to be seen, but we love what we bought and feel that we found great deals on chic new pieces. They can probably ease up on the promotional email spam, but I like their ordering app and have a few more things in my cart so I’d say they have definitely earned their 4 stars!"
Wayfair Canada,2020-04-13T15:13:54Z,1,"Ridiculous company. I asked them why it said one shipping date and then it was much later date once I finalized and paid for it!!

They canceled my order! That’s not what I wanted. Told them I still wanted the item and apparently they reversed the cancellation they did on their own accord without my consent. 

Well today I get an email saying that they have cancelled my item and issued a refund I must wait 3-5 days for????

Emailed them again asking why when I want this item. I get a I’m sorry but if you still want this item you’ll have to re order it!!! How am I supposed to do this when now apparently I have 3-5 days to wait for my money back? 

Never again. This was the first and last order from them. If I could give Zero stars I would!!!!"

Wayfair Canada,2020-04-10T01:08:30Z,1,"If I could give this site zero stars I would. I HIGHLY recommend NO ONE buy from this pathetic store. The quality is absurdly low.

Stay far away from this ridiculous level of quality control. Wayfair, take some pride in your work. Pathetic."
Wayfair Canada,2020-04-08T13:54:46Z,1,"Hello, 
I ordered my product.. everything was perfect. Chose this site, because the delivery time was just 2 weeks. It was supposed to be a birthday present.  Everything went well, package delivered. Wrong thing in the box. Ok everybody can make a mistake. I call the compagny, very nice costumer service employee. Nothing to argue. They are sorry, sending the same product, but I need to wait another 2 weeks. They can’t sent it express ??? It’s not my fault.
When you make the mistake you send it express. What is the problem? Or at least make a gesture.. a percentage off for the mistake. 
I only ordered it in this store because I wanted quick delivery. 
I would even pay half of the express shipping.. but no sorry. 
Bad service. 
Very disappointed, I have no present for this birthday and I have to wait another 2 weeks.
Sooo mad."
Wayfair Canada,2020-04-05T15:59:35Z,1,"I've bought a toilet which ended up being 50% MORE than anywhere else... even though they advertised that it was 67% off. The seat cover did not align whatsoever with this toilet. 
I then more recently wanted to buy Surefit Love seat covers... which Wayfair advertised as being on sale for 409.99$ and the same covers were 186.99USD on the Surefit website. (tried to post links to each article but this site does not allow)

WAYFAIR inflates their prices and attempts to make you think they are at a discounted price. Do your research!!"

I ordered an Inflatable hot tub for $579 with 7 day delivery, said in stock, added to cart, paid for and recieved order confirmation email. So excited to be able to get for my kids during isolation and be able to swim in it and have some activity.  Two days later I get an email that my order is cancelled due to unexpected discontinuation of the item. Then I look at the website and it's been relisted for $200 MORE.  Same model same everything.  Nice price markup and gouging just because demand is up at this time.  SHAME ON WAYFAIR.CA for being so sleazy and not honoring your own price, accepting an order and then cancelling it with a lie two days later while reposting the exact same item with a $200 markup. Disgusting and will NEVER shop with you again."

Wayfair Canada,2020-03-24T06:00:48Z,1,I have bought a few great things from Wayfair. But I have been saving up for a couch that two weeks ago was priced at $729.99 and I missed getting it before it sold out. Then I got a notification two days later that there were two back in stock. It is now $899.99!!! How does something go up that much in the price over two days!  I will not buy that couch for that price. It seems like in the midst of this pandemic they are taking advantage of this time knowing that people are having to do more online shopping now. I love the items they sell but it seems like many other companies are having sales to try and help people through this time. It really makes me not want to shop Wayfair anymore.
Wayfair Canada,2020-03-12T14:05:32Z,1,"After a month or more of trying to make some sort of sense in so far as what these people are doing (I used to believe they were actually trying to get an item I bought from them shipped to me), I have serious doubts as to whether I will ever receive this item.  I live in Canada, the item is being shipped from The US, not exactly the same as being shipped from Jupiter to Mars (but it seems like that must be the case).   They twice failed to create a customs invoice, now they say it is going along as it should and I will receive it about a month and a half after I originally ordered it.  They tell me they will ship it from their warehouse to another one of their warehouses, still in a different country from where it is supposed to be going eventually (but they won't give me a tracking number for that leg of the ((unbelievably complicated)) journey they have created for what should be a quick and easy shipment);  Once UPS picks it up from the second warehouse, still not going to me, from there they will ship it to some other Wayfair warehouse, somewhere in a very large country (and, of course, they will not give me that tracking number either - they will keep me in the dark until the item is on a truck and a few hours away, so I have no ability to be in a position to accept it).  UPS is almost as horrible a carrier as Wayfair is a shipper, I am sure they will tell me they don't care about the consignee when I tell them I can't be home, I had no notice about this, I don't want you to leave the item out in the weather and where it can be stolen, and  just go ahead and do so (I have been looking for a way to impose some sort of injunction against UPS, to bar them from my property).  I don't have the item and question whether I ever will, I should have had it a month ago.  After probably about twenty calls to Wayfair and maybe half as many to UPS, they are no closer to making a simple delivery - will never order another item from them."
Wayfair Canada,2020-03-10T23:47:25Z,1,"Bought a $200 floor lamp.  It arrived 2 weeks later.  The contents of the box looked like a poor attempt at a repack with lots of packing tape and plastic bags covering the parts.  After assembly the lamp was not sturdy, looked bent and the lens of the lamp was pushed in to far on one side and sticking out on the other.  I used a suction cup to straighten the lens a bit.
It cost me $10 to return this defective item.  Never again will I ever buy something from Wayfair.ca.  Over priced poor quality item."
Wayfair Canada,2020-03-10T21:03:13Z,1,"I am incredibly disappointed in the customer service at Wayfair Canada.  They have a Professional Program set up to supposedly help businesses, and as I am setting up a home office specifically for my writing, I investigated.  I attempted to sign up online and was blocked from doing so because I have no documentation supporting the fact that I am a writer, save for my published articles and essays.  Unimpressed, yet fine with explaining the situation, I was ready to call the next day to clarify why I am a business.  However, when I opened my email this morning I was pleasantly surprised to see the company had written me, saying I did not need to provide such official numbers after all and to simply contact them to register in the program.  I phoned and answered the man's questions, and was quickly told that I am not considered a business (despite the fact that the Government of Canada disagrees, since my work affords me the title of sole proprietor).  Thanks so much, Wayfair, for devaluing the contributions of editors and writers.  It is with great relief that I will be spending my $3,000 elsewhere, knowing the lack of importance placed by the company on the artistic and literary pursuits of this businesswoman."

When I went to school 55% off of $139.99 is not $137.99. I wrote to them to ask why the misleading pricing but they did not respond.

I called wayfair and got a story that it was not priced correctly online. Hmm... is that my problem?? No. I ordered at the price that was showing for a specific size. I did not order a 3x5. I’m so disappointed with the customer service. They told me that they sent the rug that was supposed to be at the price my rug ordered at. Nobody informed me during the 12 days from placing the order. You expect me to be happy?? And you refuse to budge on the price due to YOUR error. Not a happy customer. Then you ask me to return the rug to a UPS station!?!? Your error, you come pick it up. I don’t want the offered 10% off my next purchase that was offered to me. I ordered something specific and you substitute for what you decide. No thank you. I will no longer be ordering you this site. A very upset and disappointed customer."

(I'd left the country for 3 years to live in Europe, and so when I returned to Canada I needed all new stuff, ha!). 

Anyway, every single item I ordered from them has been wonderful quality. I'm absolutely in love with my couch (the Roberta 84"" Tuxedo Arm Sofa in green). It's been almost a year and it still looks brand new! Everything ships fast and their customer service is truly incredible. For the comforter set, they accidentally sent me 2, and when I called to let them know they kindly told me to donate the second one (rather than making me return it or wait at home for them to come back to get it), so I was able to give people in need a nice new comforter set, which felt good too! 

Honestly, Wayfair has just been so nice to deal with, and I love the quality of everything I purchased from them. I'm a tough reviewer, too—it's rare I feel this good about a company (there's always something off, I swear!), but I have zero bad things to say about them. Thanks for the great products and great customer service!"
Wayfair Canada,2020-02-17T23:53:43Z,1,I have ordered two things from Wayfair that I have not been happy about. The first thing I ordered was a small table that was white in the display and when I received it needs to be painted. I spent $300 on a small unfinished table that I could have gotten elsewhere for about $60 the quality was very poor. The second thing I ordered was a metal bunk bed the holes for the screws did not line up on some of the polls and I had to drill extra holes into the bunk bed for quality again. I will not order from Wayfair they are overpriced with low and poor quality items writing a review blank blank
Wayfair Canada,2020-02-15T00:05:37Z,2,"Ordered a black recliner in Nov and less then 3 mths later foam on seat popped up. Called Wayfair they promised a new seat to be delivered Feb 14th not here. Not pleased with the quality and asked if I could order something else, told 30 days for return or replacement even though I purchased extra 3 year warranty on same. This is the first and last time I will deal with Wayfair, and delivery of said chair was left on front walkway in the snow."
Wayfair Canada,2020-02-07T17:12:16Z,1,"This review is for the customer service I received from Wayfair:
I called to get more information about replacement parts I had ordered, as I haven’t received any email confirming they have been ordered or any type of confirmation, ( parts ordered in January). I connected with a Women named “Sydney”, I started to explain my problem and issue, she responded “ we didn’t send an email because we did not want to further upset you regarding our parts being on a huge back order” seriously it upsets me MORE that I have no idea what’s going on with my order, I try to explain this to the women and she continuously speaks over me getting louder, so I got louder, eventually yelling, as she was as well. Totally inappropriate on her behave, she obviously has no idea what she is doing, and I hope no one else gets treated like this, we are the customers we DESERVE and have the RIGHT to know what is going on with items we have BOUGHT with our MONEY."
Wayfair Canada,2020-02-04T07:45:59Z,1,"After ordering two products on Wayfair that gave me an estimate of 3 day delivery, it did not come in on time. 2.5 weeks past after date and I called in after what I thought was being patient. Customer service service seemed very confused and not helpful with just saying we will follow up in 2 days. No follow up was made with me so I called back after 3 days. I got the same response with no idea or answer on what was going on with my product. Customer service I felt was not good and did not help resolve my issue, last time I'll order off of Wayfair."
Wayfair Canada,2020-02-02T05:24:32Z,1,"We just moved to our new house and I was planning on ordering furnitures worth $10,000 on Wayfair! And I saw alot of reviews OMG alot of you are not happy with this company.  I feel like you guys saved my money. So thank you!!!  I am going else where. Any recomendations?"
Wayfair Canada,2020-02-01T02:33:18Z,5,"I spoke to a representative that was SUPER NICE, her name was HOPE A. My dog bed was stolen and I was so frustrated since they left the package at my doorstep, and I called and she gave me a full refund! I appreciate her kindness and understanding, she even offered to reship the bed but unfortunately I get my fur baby in a few days and I can’t go without a bed for him for that amount of time. She understood and provided full refund and for that, she was amazing!!!"
Wayfair Canada,2020-01-31T12:19:29Z,1,"Do not order from Wayfair!! The prices look okay and then you place your order and realize you're not going to get it for another month.

I ordered in January and won't get it until Feb 20th.  Way after it's needed."
Wayfair Canada,2020-01-31T04:25:22Z,1,"I saw a You Copia 24 adjustable spice rack on 
the Wayfair Canada website for $93.00 and because I have a business my price was on sale for $89.99
I then was on the Shopping Channel website also in Canada in Toronto and saw an identical You Copia 24 adjustable spice rack for $49.99
It was The shopping Channel regular price
It was not on sale or a blockbuster price just their regular price .
I sent 3 emails to Wayfair asking why they charge 
$93.00/ for me $89.99 for the identical product that the Shopping Channel sells for 
$49.99 regular price .
Well I first got a person called Susan but she could not answer me , so Doug wrote me asking me for more information about this product
I had sent them pictures and prices of both Thevshopping channels item and pricw and the Wayfair picture of the item and price but again Doug had no answer for me why there was such a difference in price 
I told them I will always question that wayfair is not a company I can trust regarding prices because I will forever now think they are overcharging the customer .
Well finally I got some other gentleman that offerrred me that article
For what I had already bought at the Shopping Channel cuz they kept me waiting for an answer .
I did however check their website and that article
I’d still at $93/ or $89.99 if another business person that was registered with wayfair Professional .
So all I can say is do your homework before you decide to purchase anything from Wayfair 
Check with the shopping channel in canada 
TSC.ca or check with Amazon .ca if you are Canadian cuz they show canadian prices .
It’s always good to shop around because we all work hard for our money and no one enjoys being made a fool of or being overcharged .
Between $93.00 to $49.99 is a huge huge difference in a companies mark up structure .
Just beware .

Wayfair Canada,2020-01-29T23:43:12Z,1,"I’ve purchased from Wayfair in the past. The service used to be really good and I never used to have problems. I ordered a couch five weeks ago and it arrived today and it was the wrong colour and wrong material. It was fluorescent turquoise. The drivers realized it was the wrong piece when I showed them what I ordered from my phone. I came back inside and phoned Wayfair and the woman offered no apologies and told me that she could not exchange it but just give me a refund. When I mentioned to her that I didn’t have a  couch at all because I got rid of my old one because I was getting a new one, she didn’t say anything. Dead air.  I told her this was a big inconvenience and she hung up on me.  Well, she made a bad situation worse with that response. I wasn’t looking for somebody to kiss my behind, I was looking for an acknowledgement of the mistake. I never got one."
Wayfair Canada,2020-01-29T05:38:11Z,5,I have purchased over 40 items from Wayfair and have had nothing but excellent service from the point of purchase to delivery and customer service.  It is however imperative to read reviews before purchasing to avoid disappointment as you are ordering something unseen.  I never order anything with poor reviews regarding the quality of the product.  I have received a couple of damaged items which were always promptly replaced or my money refunded without questions or any hassles.  I can't say enough about the Customer Service department.  You can't ask for better.
Wayfair Canada,2020-01-20T14:54:19Z,2,"I recently had a package delivered to my house fro Wayfair. I was originally told my package would arrive Feb 3rd. I received no updates on the new shipping details or an email on the tracking number from them. The delivery guy left the package in front of our garage where the box was soaking wet and damaged. My neighbour rang my doorbell to let me know. Quite disappointing as this is my first order with Wayfair and this is how I received my item. It was also not a cheap purchase, so I expected more helpful suggestions from them."
Wayfair Canada,2020-01-16T04:05:47Z,2,"Customer service was great and they deserve a 5+ rating. But, where it all falls apart is with delivery and product  I ordered two dressers before Xmas 2019. They delivered one and the other was on back order until May 2020. The website was only updated out of stock during my phone call to  customer service. The manufacturer made a mistake and forgot to update the web on his end. The dresser that was delivered was damaged pretty badly. Customer Service was great 
but I had to throw out the dresser.  I ordered  another set last week both were delivered today quite damaged. Customer Sevicec was great but ultimately I don't have dressers. Sooooo, I'm going elsewhere. Thanks anyway Wayfair. I have alot of packaging to break down and throw out. Now that's an inconvenience."
Wayfair Canada,2020-01-14T19:54:22Z,1,Tried to order a pastel colored play pot/pan dish set for my granddaughter. Price was $33.99 plus shipping but it was on backorder. Found the exact same set on another site for $13.99 with free shipping. Guess which company gets my business from now on?
Wayfair Canada,2020-01-14T17:34:59Z,1,"I used Paybright, but due to a VERY lengthily delivery I canceled the order.
Paybright is now demanding me pay out the loan “I must get Wayfair to contact them regarding the cancelation. Wayfair is refusing to contact Paybright, Paybright is refusing to contact Waifair. They are saying that I must pay them out. I can later be reimbursed should they get the cancelation order (minus interest and fees). This is unacceptable. So now it has cost me a cancel payment charge and they have run my credit thru the toilet. 
JOY
I am expected to pay for something I will never see, Wayfair canceled the product. Lol 
Sounds like fraud to me.

Well after 8 months of wrangling. Things were “cleared up?” Yes the order that never existed went to collections.

Pay Bright told me I had to contact Wayfair to clear things up. Wayfair told me to contact Progressive (owner of PayBright) to clear things up. Progressive told me to contact PayBright. You can see where things are going. They cleared things up but forgot to cancel the collection agent. Another 30 days to do this with about 8 calls a day to me telling me I was a looser.

So I was offered compensation.? Huh? So PayBright offered me a gift card that never came. Wayfair offered me a “small” discount on a single purchase of not to much money. And Progressive said they hoped I learned my lesson and not to use these order process. The Collection agent said he still feels I am a looser and should have paid for the order that I never made.

Wayfair Canada,2020-01-07T15:57:06Z,1,"They neither stand by their description or have any credible customer service reps (CSR). The type of CSR's they have are the type of people who pat themselves on the back or get ribbons of participation even if they did a poor job. After weeks of back and forth banter and of their rude CSR implying I was an imbecile on more than three times. I decided to still be as polite as I could be yet throw back their casual insults into their face. I called them, ""boneheads""...  What I got back was a shock. 

The CSR who answered me put more effort into chewing me out for the use of the word bonehead than actually bothering to answer my question which preceded the use of the word, ""bonehead"". So they can insult us and imply we're the boneheads, but when we call them  boneheads they throw up their arms and cite us for being bad/rude people??? Huh??? She's lucky I only used the word, ""bonehead"" instead of the word(s), I really wanted to use. 

The incident revolves around a particular chair that by their description claimed the max weight limit was 331 pounds. An odd number but when I downloaded the instruction manual of how to assemble said product, in BOLD text on the front of the PDF book was the words, ""300 pounds maximum"". Yet both their website and their own CSR keep quoting 331 as the maximum without any actual evidence to support it, we have to go by the manufacturers claim and not their typo. 

Yet when that chair didn't fit my requirements of minimum 300 pound weight and minimum 22"" seat height, the clueless CSR began to suggest other products which didn't meet my minimum requirements of both height and weight and the only reason why she kept trying to shove useless products into my face was the fact both items were blue. 

Don't need to go by my rantings. Simply look into the Q&A sections of any product and look at the answers their staff give. Often they are out right wrong and the proof is in their own description, or they must be blind because by their own pictures that is proof enough. Like telling me because the chair didn't fit me for both my height and weight, I can simply tilt the chair back... tilt the chair back is exactly what she said. 

That chair has NO TILT function. From the 5+ pictures of that chair from various angles we can easily see not to mention the download PDF manual there is NO TILT function on that chair. Yet because of my minimum height and weight requirements for the chair, her solution was for me to tilt the chair... CAN WE SAY BONEHEAD!!!

p.s. The chair in question was the Tahmid Task Chair by Orren Ellis, and since my rude encounter, they fixed their 331 pound typo and removed the claim it had a tilt adjustment. But it shouldn't take a rude CSR and our own work to proofread their site. I did more work looking up manufacturer and asking them directly than their own clueless ignorant boneheads did."
Wayfair Canada,2020-01-06T07:17:24Z,1,"Ordered a dining room sideboard from them at a cost of $1100 described as a ""sophisticated addition to one's home"". Spent 2 days waiting for the 4 boxes to arrive. 1 box came and 2 days later the other 3 arrived. They blamed it on Fedex. Ok... I open the boxes and begin to assemble the item. Chipped wood, poorly mitred corners, missing patches of wood stain, legs described as aluminum (just silver paint)....I wouldn't put this item in a college frat house! My options according to customer service were to trash the item and they'd send me another (had lost confidence and I would have needed a truck), return it at MY COST for a full refund or keep this piece of s**t and they'd refund me $600. I opted for the latter. It's in the basement gathering dust and waiting for a kid to go to college! And to add insult to injury, they blocked me from reviewing the product! Never again will I buy anything from Wayfair. Sheisters!"
Wayfair Canada,2020-01-05T02:29:01Z,1,"We ordered sliding barn doors from Wayfair recently and were very disappointed in the damage of all three sets of doors ordered. We spent considerable time fixing them in order for them to be ready for a special event we had planned. Although Wayfair apologized, gave us a discount off the cost, and sent another door to replace the severely damaged one, the one they sent was more damaged than the one it was replacing and was missing screws needed to put it together! I would not recommend Wayfair if you depend on time of delivery and quality of the product."
Wayfair Canada,2020-01-05T01:50:48Z,1,"On Dec 10th I ordered the Aerogarden Bounty Systems (set of 4) as advertised on the Wayfair website (in which it is still being offered on their website... but out of stock) for $569.00. which means each unit would be approx $150 each. Approx 10 days later I received ONE box with ONE unit in it. I contacted Wayfair and explained that is was supposed to be FOUR units as advertised. The gentleman who took my call saw the problem and apologized for it. He also cancelled the first order and re-processed it to make sure that 4 units are delivered and said to keep the one single unit we got at no charge for the inconvenience. (Also confirmed with an email) On Jan 2/20 I received another ONE single unit. Again, I called and spoke with someone regarding this problem.  After speaking with several people and being passed on and on,  I was told it was DEFINITELY a mistake by Wayfair and that under NO circumstances could they honor the deal.(Even after I paid and received 2 units) I explained I have already paid and have given these items as Christmas gifts. They said they could discount my purchase, I could keep the TWO units but I will NOT receive any more units. I do not want a discount I want what I purchased and paid for. They took my money no problem.  They said I could go and buy from a competitor with the difference in money they give back. Unfortunately there is no place selling the product for the price I paid. Also if they had told me earlier, I would have been able to look for a sale price. But now Christmas and boxing day are over and everything is back to regular price. She directed me to the ""terms of use"" and said they can cancel or change any order they want whenever they want. WOW. Jan 3/20 they offered to refund my money and I will not get anymore units.  If it wasn't my mistake why am I being punished? If I buy elsewhere I am paying almost the same price I paid for 4 units that I would have to pay for one. I gave 4 units away as gifts.  Also I ordered all the pods to go with 4 units and can not return them.  What will I do with 90 pods???  No one seemed to notice that there was a problem until I called in.  They also said that I am the only person who ordered this and had this problem. Ya right so why are they sold out?... obviously other people bought them. If I am the only person who did purchase this product then why would it be so hard to just send me the other units? It would cost th next to nothing compared to the money they make daily. Now they have angered a customer off who will spread the news how crappy of a company they are. I am absolutely appalled at this whole situation and will NEVER EVER buy from Wayfair again. It has also put a sour taste n my mouth with regards to Aerogarden products which isn't fair to that company.  The funny thing about this story is that SO many people had told me horror stories about Wayfair and I always disagreed.  I stuck up for them saying that Wayfair was the best company and had the best customer service. Well that's a joke. I no longer feel that way and I will now express my distaste for them to anyone that asks or even speaks of Wayfair.  I have worked in retail for over 25 years and if we ever made a mistake, we fixed it properly so the customer was happy and returned for our services. THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT!! Just ridiculous!!!!!! Very disappointing!!"
Wayfair Canada,2020-01-03T15:20:24Z,1,"Do not trust the ""sale"" marketing.

I have been eyeing a dresser that matches our bed drawers but haven't gotten around buying it yet because it is over 1k  (which I find a little excessive). At first the price was $1189.99 CAD (early December), so I decided to wait and see if it goes on sale during boxing week. A week before boxing week it went up to $1,229.99 CAD. And then I refreshed the browser on boxing week the price hasn't changed, however now it says it's on sale.. I have lost all trust on this site.
So if you shop there, be aware that the sale sign is just a lie."
Wayfair Canada,2020-01-02T04:05:01Z,1,"I ordered a stocking almost a month prior to Christmas at the end of November for my daughter. The estimated delivery date was December 6th. I did not receive the stocking so a week later I contacted Wayfair to see what was going on. I was told it was stuck in a warehouse but not to worry as it will arrive before Christmas. A week later I still had not received the stocking or an update so I contacted Wayfair again. They said it was still stuck in a warehouse and they couldn’t tell me any more information at the time but someone would contact me in a day or two. No one contacted me so I called again and asked for a manager. I was then told again that they couldn’t give me answers until they contacted the warehouse and that there was no guarantee this item would arrive before Christmas. I cancelled my order as there was no point in getting the stocking after Christmas. I spoke with a supervisor and asked how I could leave a review as the Wayfair website wasn’t letting me. She said I could email her the review and she would post it online. After several days my review was still not posted online. I called again and spoke with another supervisor who told me I could not post a review since I cancelled my order. I told her I didn’t want to review the product I wanted to review Wayfairs services but she said I couldn’t do that. If Wayfair doesn’t let customers review their customer service I do not think the reviews accurately represent the services the company provides (which were terrible in my case). Throughout the month I was dealing with this order, tracking it down, speaking to several different people and not having anyone contact me back (even though they assured me I would receive follow up) I could have found a different stocking for my daughter but instead Wayfair wasted my time and told nothing but lies. If I could give them zero stars I would have. This was my first experience with Wayfair and it was a terrible one! I will not be shopping at Wayfair again and I will not be recommending their services or products to friends and family."
Wayfair Canada,2020-01-01T11:17:19Z,5,I think Wayfair is an excellent company. They have good quality items and such a huge selection to choose from. Best of all is their customer service. I would highly recommend and plan to shop here in the new year😊
Wayfair Canada,2019-12-28T17:52:31Z,1,"I usually do not write a review on bad products but since ive spent a lot of money from Wayfair, I’ve regretted what I purchased. The pull out coach that I bought feels like a cardboard box and when you sit on it, doesn’t feel comfortable at all.
I really wish I could have my money back or get a replacement supplemented by this company. I loved going on their website browsing through items which I thought was good quality."
Wayfair Canada,2019-12-24T04:16:32Z,1,"This company sells garbage and jacks up the price, I bought a computer desk for over 400 dollars and when I opened it, it damn near fell apart during the building process, as it was made out of cheap pressed wood. How do you sell the cheapest pressed wood for over 400 dollars? What a joke."
Wayfair Canada,2019-12-24T01:21:19Z,5,"In my experience Wayfair’s customer service has been outstanding. I have ordered from them multiple times now and had 2 problems that they corrected swiftly and to my satisfaction. The first issue I had was right after Black Friday and when I called I almost immediately was put through to a rep who solved my problem in 5 minutes. I had to call another company the same day and the wait time for that company was over 50 mins.
I emailed them about the second issue this afternoon and within an hour they got back to me with a solution.
Very impressed with Wayfair!"
Wayfair Canada,2019-12-21T11:56:19Z,5,By now I've ordered a number of pieces of furniture.  They're always well packaged.  They arrive on time.  They're reasonably good quality for the money.  Customer service is excellent.  I really like Wayfair.
Wayfair Canada,2019-12-20T12:50:21Z,5,"I had ordered a quite few items from Wayfair Canada, Almond of those orders, they included my bath tub, lighting in the staircase, kitchen vent hood. Of course, there were some issues with some products. However, my experiences with Wayfair are all very good, they have super customer service, all issues had been solved and I am happy with the results. I am surprised to see that there are so many bad reviews here, but, I like Wayfair Canada, it is a good company and has super costumer service."
Wayfair Canada,2019-12-20T00:42:17Z,1,Horrible company dont buy from them the shipping date was false and took over a month to come.
Wayfair Canada,2019-12-19T22:28:39Z,3,Driver didnt ring bell just left heavy item against garage door where can be seen from street. Item is fine not impressed with delivery driver. Item could of damaged garage door if opened while item leaning on it. At least attempt to ring bell next time.  not the first time this has happened.
Wayfair Canada,2019-12-17T21:15:07Z,5,I’ve ordered twice this year (2019) from Wayfair and have been very pleased each time.  Both products arrived in good shape and were very easy to assemble.  Prior to ordering  I compared Wayfair prices to other sites and could not find a cheaper price listed.
Wayfair Canada,2019-12-17T02:07:53Z,5,Had an issue with the shipping and customer service took care of everything. Charles F went above and beyond and gave me a partial refund and made sure the product was arriving on time. Will definitely purchase again
Wayfair Canada,2019-12-16T05:34:33Z,1,"Every single order ive made with wayfair has had an issue.

1) ordered a lamp. Came dented and broken. They had to send us a new one
2) ordered a sideboard. Arrived with the top of the unit cracked in half.
They sent us a new sideboard. Arrived with the bottom of the unit cracked in half.  Ended up getting a full refund, but no sideboard. Gave up after 2 broken ones
3) ordered two night stands, middle of september. One arrived on time, other arrived a week later (shipped the same day, exact same item). Nightstand one. Went together nicely, save for a small scratch on the top.
Nightstand two had an incorrect part. Called wayfair, said they would send a replacement part by nov 11. 3 delayed shipping notices later, we finally receive a whole new nightstand replacement on december 9. Open up the box, its a completely different night stand.  
Called wayfair, gave us a small discount ($9 off of a $275 nightstand) and said that they would be shipping us a new nightstand - the correct one.
Arriving dec 24. Fingers crossed this is correct.
Its been 3 months now of this nightstand drama.

This will likely be my last order with wayfair. I feel like ive given them enough chances. Every.single.order has been damaged or incorrect.

I dont understand how this business makes any money."
Wayfair Canada,2019-12-13T17:16:29Z,1,"I ordered an accent piece for my wall and when I placed the order it said “get it by Dec. 10th” then the delivery date changed to Dec. 11th, and then changed again to Dec. 12th. Finally, on the 13th of Dec, I received a delivery, but it was not the item I ordered, it was a side table. I called customer service and the woman I spoke to said that they will arrange for FedEx to pick up the side table, but I will not be getting the item I ordered until Dec. 24th! I specially ordered this item because of the “get it by” date on their site and now i’m not getting it until Dec. 24th. This was my first order with Wayfair and it may be my last. Very disappointed!"
Wayfair Canada,2019-12-12T05:21:50Z,1,"This is an untrustworthy online  seller. I  bought on line a 3 drawer dresser and it states on the website that delivery date is December 18, 2019. This is very attractive to me since my nephew who is going to live with us will arrive on the 17th. One day wait is still perfect. However when they sent me an email which I was able to read 2 days after it states that the item will be delivered on Dec. 31st 2019 and another email was sent saying delivery date is Jan. 1, 2020. I told Morgan the lady I spoke with on the phone that on their website it said “ buy now delivery date Dec 18 2019. Now I want to cancel but the item has shipped and I will be responsible to pay the shipping if I return it. Isn’t that a fraud? Enticing you to buy and promised to deliver on a certain date then when you pay they change the delivery date, that’s how untrustworthy and unprofessional wayfair.ca work on my book. This will make me not buy online unless its Amazon.com. By the way I gave one star rating since it should have been this 👎👎👎👎👎👎"
Wayfair Canada,2019-12-10T15:27:28Z,1,Disorganised. Not user-friendly. Long wait times. They do not  touch base if there is an issue. Garbage.
Wayfair Canada,2019-12-10T04:48:05Z,1,Terrible!! I ordered an item in December 4th and tried to cancel 10 minutes later. I received an email the next day which said my order could not be cancelled. The status of the item has now said preparing for Shipping for 4 days and I still can’t cancel. Item also went on sale and they won’t let me cancel or give a price adjustment!!  Yet still the item has not even been shipped yet
Wayfair Canada,2019-12-08T03:08:14Z,1,I ordered a Dutch Floral Wallmural from the Netherlands by designer Ellie Cashman to put in my powder room. Wayfair is featuring this exact as Ammerman Peony Wallpaper on their website by House of Hampton! That’s fraudulent! Shame on you! Artists work hard to develop their business and want only good things associated with their works. I will tell everyone I know to never shop from this website and explain the reason why. A customer no longer Wayfair. And to the consumer who is considering purchasing knock offs. The artists who strive to deliver their works are often living hand to mouth and feeding families. Think before you make that purchase.
Wayfair Canada,2019-12-06T19:07:33Z,1,"I specifically chose products showing ""in stock"" when I placed an order of 6 items with Wayfair.

I was informed quickly after, that one item is out of stock and the delivery date was much later. So I cancelled this item

One item arrived damaged

A few days later, they informed me that one item was discontinued and no longer available. As I built the entire room design based on this item, a sofa (there were items that I had also sourced from other suppliers), I had to cancel the rest of the order, which they were ok to do but was a start of a royal mess; in addition, I had to redesign the entire place and source new products, which was unbillable time for me.

Briefly, some items were delivered anyway, and despite the emails I received ensuring a refund, none of the refunds were made. I had to call the service team to go over every item and made sure a refund was requested. And I still have to follow up next week to ensure I received the refunds.

This wasn't the first time Wayfair messed up. They do have lovely and efficient sales and customer service teams but their website doesn't reflect the actual state of products and their refund department is not efficient.

Hope you find this review helpful"
Wayfair Canada,2019-11-30T22:08:49Z,1,"Terrible, terrible company. Placed an order today and paid for it, only for Wayfair to arbitrarily - and without notifying me - cancel the order because they suspected “fraudulent activity”. They had countless opportunities to verify my information not just today, but over the last couple of days when their agents kept harassing me with phone calls to complete my order. Now that I’ve read other reviews of them, I wish I had before wasting my time and effort placing that order. Do business with them at your own risk!!"
Wayfair Canada,2019-11-28T18:14:59Z,1,"Can I give zero stars.  Wayfair Canada is downright appalling.  The price gouging and advertisement of misleading free shipping should be illegal.  They advertise duty and free shipping - It's built into the price, which is why many items are 75%+ higher than the US site.  Items can take a very long time to arrive. The final straw for me is an exact item that I found in Canada for $100 cheaper (that included shipping fees).  I will no longer waste my time visiting their website.  Canadians, do your research! I realize we have few options for decent shopping, but there are much better vendors out there."
Wayfair Canada,2019-11-26T11:38:44Z,1,"Ordered a computer desk with a raised monitor shelf and then found out two monitors were going on this computer a couple of hours later. Tried to cancel order, but cancellation software would not work on their website. Then phoned and they said it was in shipping already, even though the progress bar of the order did not show this. Said they could not cancel it at their end, but would allow return and pay shipping both ways. Asked them to make note on file about this. Now it's 3 days and no reply to my asking about return shipping."
Wayfair Canada,2019-11-22T16:52:44Z,1,"absolute worst customer service. I was attempting to purchase furniture for my new house while moving and my order was cancelled due to my shipping and billing addresses being different..because I am moving. I called and spoke with two representatives who were extremely unsupportive or helpful in their process and told me that I would have to ship my orders to my old house. So I would then have to pay to have the furniture shipped from the house I no longer live in to my new house. I was not provided with any other solutions or assistance. I was looking forward to trying Wayfair Canada as I had never purchased furniture from them before. I Would definitely not recommend purchasing from them as their customer service was horrible, particularly if you are moving. It is stressful enough, go somewhere they support their customers."
Wayfair Canada,2019-11-22T13:16:58Z,5,"I don't know why this company gets such terrible reviews. I bought a fireplace worth $1100 which FedEx sent to the wrong address. With full trust in me, Wayfair solved the problem and send another out. Later that night the lost mantel ended up showing up at my door. Unfortunately it had some black scuffs and dents and didn't sit flush into itself. I called Wayfair again, and they refunded me 100% of my money and told me to donate the mantel to a charity. I didn't need to pay for these outrageous return fees I kept reading about, and it went to a good place! How wonderful!!!"
Wayfair Canada,2019-11-20T20:11:32Z,1,"I ordered a table which was promised by a certain date and never received it so Wayfair took 25% off the price and recommended to order it again because it was lost. I ordered it again and they added a $50 discount and I waited another 10 days and again, never recieved it so seeing that this was for my son's new apartment and he waited a month and had to eat on his bed because he didn't have a table I cancelled the order and bought a table elsewhere. 

I asked for some kind of compensation for having my son eat on a bed for a month without a table and they said they couldn't do anything except give a 10% coupon on my next order and I told her I wasn't going to be ordering anything again from Wayfair but still nothing more was offered."
Wayfair Canada,2019-11-20T16:37:24Z,1,Ordered a love seat had it a few months and it broke called and replaced no hassle.  Now for the second time exact same thing and they refuse to replace it or nothing.  Being handicap I cant use it cause I cant put it down.  Never again will I purchase anything from here.
Wayfair Canada,2019-11-18T21:15:07Z,5,"WOW. I am shocked. So many negative reviews. I only read the reviews because I am about to write one. I have bought about 5 items from this company. Prices, delivery and quality are excellent. I have no complaints. I will contiue to use Wayfair Canada until they prove otherwise."
Wayfair Canada,2019-11-15T21:54:45Z,2,"This company is SHADY. Everything feels like it fell off the back of a truck or something. Look closely before you buy anything. They sell regular brands you can get anywhere but slap their own trendy “vanity name” on it. Like ‘Oren Ellis’ and ‘Ivy Knox.’ I most recently saw a Rove Concepts chair for sale on there under a different name, for literally double the price. Rove was selling the chair for $895 and wayfair for $1600. Identical chair, identical photos. I don’t know how they get away with this. It’s misleading and dishonest."
Wayfair Canada,2019-11-13T02:51:15Z,1,"Wayfair does not list on its site which products contain harmful and toxic chemicals. I got my beautiful sofa today, which came with a lovely big label on the underside, letting me know that this product can expose me to ""chemicals including di(2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) which are known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm"" 
if they listed this in the product description I would not have bought this item. I feel really deceived and kind of taken advantage of. Do I warn guests that my couch might lower their sperm count? 
It's really wild how corporate greed runs unchecked; these maniacs are literally killing off humanity and poisoning our ecosystem but yet, they have more rights than you and I. Wild. 
Needless to say I'm repulsed by Wayfair and intend to soapbox the hell out of my thoughts on it."
Wayfair Canada,2019-11-12T00:45:45Z,1,I have ordered numerous times in the past with no real issue and always free shipping. I spent hours on their site finding the “perfect” buffet. When I got to the checkout they wanted to charge me $400.00 delivery on an $850.00 item!! When I called the company the girl on the phone could have cared less so I asked to speak with a manager. He disclosed to me that there is NO free shipping to Canada anymore! I told him that they should change their website to reflect this so we don’t bother wasting our time even looking. $400.!!!! Within a half an hour I had received yet another email from Wayfair advertising free shipping on orders over $75.00....
Wayfair Canada,2019-11-02T18:22:42Z,1,"Placed the order for bar stools. Couple of days later got the notification of order being shipped. Status showed out for delivery. Once the promised date passed, I contacted Customer Service and heard that FedEx had it in its possession. I requested a waybill # to trace it. Turned out FedEx never received the pickup order, which left no choice to Wayfair but admit that they do not have them in stock and they need to reorder for me... Wait time - another 1.5 months. I decided to wait. Another expected delivery date arrived - no shipment though... Contacted Wayfair again and... learned that they are out of stock, yet shipping status remained unchanged with expected delivery 1.5 months ago... I was offered to reorder and wait another month. I refused. I just don't believe that I would get it anymore... I'm extremely disappointed."
Wayfair Canada,2019-11-02T07:57:11Z,1,They say they offer free shipping after spending $75.00. I ordered many times in the past few years and never paid shipping! Now all of a sudden they don't ship to my area! Customer service Said to me Im sorry we don't ship to your area anymore! They Lie!!!!
Wayfair Canada,2019-11-02T01:57:55Z,2,"Ordered a bed, it arrived a week after the expected delivery date. It was absolute rubbish. We called and were told to return it. UPS, on behalf of Wayfair, was told to pickup the bed however they don't seem to want to, as they have missed 3 pickup dates. Now have a giant box living in our dining room. No end in sight. Bad quality, bad service  just bad....."
Wayfair Canada,2019-11-01T16:20:36Z,1,"Their price is very high compare to the retail store and you don't see the real product. They use nice photos to exaggerate the size and look of the products to mislead costumers.  If you are not happy with the product and want to return, you have to pay the shipping cost out of your own pocket. I wouldn't order anything from Wayfair.ca again. Such a pain!!!"
Wayfair Canada,2019-10-29T18:54:49Z,5,"I am from Hamilton On. I have ordered from Wayfair for at least a year now, since I have an Airbnb. I am not saying they are perfect but to this day I haven’t had a problem with product or the company."
Wayfair Canada,2019-10-23T14:04:51Z,1,Terrible company. Ordered a dining set from their website and it was listed at 47% off. After purchasing the set they cancelled my order and said that it was the wrong pricing and that i would have to pay full price. What a SCAM!! First time i ever tried to order from them....and last time I try to order from them. Wayfair you have nothing i need.
Wayfair Canada,2019-10-19T13:48:02Z,1,"Cancer causing chemicals used on four chairs I purchased. I fould out the hard way after purchasing and seeing a warning sticker on the chairs. Wayfair is charging me 45 dollars out of my pocket to return them. Even though their web site is very vauge about the serious warning. The waring is a California law and in not in the US. By law, a warning must be given for listed chemicals unless the exposureis low enough to pose no significant risk of cancer or is significantly below levels observed to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm."
Wayfair Canada,2019-10-16T21:00:57Z,1,"So I have ordered from this site on appx 4 occasions Do your homework look at pricing elsewhere first and foremost.
I ordered handles for a clients cabinets and 2 were damaged had to wait 10 days for first order. Replacements were due to arrive Oct 9 th they did not waited almost 3 weeks for replacements to arrive.
The other items I have to say arrived late all the time pricing is NOT that great either after I checked pricing elsewhere."
Wayfair Canada,2019-10-16T09:04:00Z,1,cross border shipping nightmare
Wayfair Canada,2019-10-12T01:30:52Z,1,"Even less than one star , worst experience ever , never buy again from this site"
Wayfair Canada,2019-10-10T22:20:27Z,1,"I have been waiting for my pick for return items for all week, I've been calling every day and been  placed on hold for 30 min each time, it cause me so much aggravation and time.
Still nobody came to pick it up.

Would never buy from Wayfair again."
Wayfair Canada,2019-10-09T23:18:55Z,1,They say they have free shipping but apparently not to my city even though a year ago they shipped to me for free. They want to charge me $60 on $300 worth of merchandise because I'm out of the free shipping zone. Something I wish I knew before I wasted 2 hrs looking through their website. When I called to find out when it changed they blamed it on UPS reconfiguring their shipping areas. Wayfair you should find a new courier or quit falsely advertising free shipping as it sureleaves customers with a horrible impression of your company.
Wayfair Canada,2019-10-09T01:00:46Z,1,"I wish I could give zero stars. This was the worst experience I’ve ever had with a company. I ordered a playground for my kitten and the day it was supposed to come I waited all day, the next day I noticed the delivery status went “unavailable” so I looked at history of shipment and it said “fed ex reporting missing paperwork from WayFair”. Well no wonder I didn’t get my delivery. I called FedEx and they said they tried to reach WayFair multiple times but they weren’t answering their requests for the paperwork. I called WayFair and the guy laughed and said there’s no way, and that it must be FedEx’s mistake. This did not help my situation and there was no empathy or understanding to how frustrated I was having to call around. I was supposed to get a call back in 48 hours from a “case manager”.... it’s been a week and a half and here I am STILL waiting for this case manager to call me back and spending my 5th night calling WayFair customer service and being told complete nonsense by people who have no idea what’s going on or any sense of understanding to how frustrating this is. I’m told different information by every single one of them and they have no idea the status of my order or date I’m getting it.

I’ve lost hope I’ll ever get this product and I’ve wasted hours of my life on the phone to the point I don’t even want to go through trying to cancel it because I don’t trust them to refund me. 

Would NOT recommend."
Wayfair Canada,2019-10-03T00:59:29Z,1,"I am extremely disappointed with how Wayfair handled a recent transaction of mine. I purchased an 8 X 10 area rug from the website, however, when it arrived at my house it was the wrong size (3 X 5). I immediately called Wayfair without even opening the package, and spoke to a customer service representative who was wonderful and acknowledged the mistake Wayfair had made. Turns out, the pricing they had listed on their website was wrong, and if I wanted the 8 X 10 I would have to pay an additional $300. The woman agreed with me that it was a mistake on the website and Wayfair's side, and that the price should be honoured on my end. I was advised that a new, 8 X 10 rug would be on it's way to me at no additional charge - great! The next day, I received a missed call and subsequent voicemail from someone else at Wayfair saying that there had been a mistake, and that I would not be receiving a new 8 X 10 rug at no cost, and if I wanted that size I would have to cough up the difference. How is that right? I purchased what was quoted on the website and that price/size should have been honoured, regardless of any website glitches they may have experienced. I spoke to a manager and they were unable to change the outcome either. Now I have to deal with returning the old rug before I can even receive my refund in full on my credit card. Poor customer service, poor loyalty to your customers and overall poor business practices in Wayfair failing to own up to its mistake and make the situation right. I am very unhappy with the transaction and the service received and will not be ordering from this site anytime soon."
Wayfair Canada,2019-10-02T23:05:42Z,1,"Waited for 6 weeks for a bedroom set. After 6 weeks, I was told that the set arrived at the delivery centre but is missing some pieces that are lost."
Wayfair Canada,2019-09-26T18:06:49Z,1,"Ordered a chair which took 3 weeks to ship, but the delivery guy decided that it was easier to leave a post-it note than the actual chair at my apartment, in which i was waiting. So after 3 weeks, I have to wait another few days and then drive an hour to pick it up.

On the way to picking up the chair I'll be passing a number of furniture stores, any one of which will be the destination for my next purchase rather than wasting my [censored] time with these clowns."
Wayfair Canada,2019-09-23T21:40:00Z,1,"I ordered a bed for my daughter. After a week and a half of Wayfair telling me it was shipped I called FedEx and was told they never received the package. Wayfair told me then that the bed was out of stock and issued a refund which takes 3-5 days to get to me. I've already waited almost 2 weeks and now have to wait for my refund before I can actually go buy a bed from a real store. This is the first and last time I use Wayfair. Oh, I forgot to mention they offered me a whopping 10 percent off my next purchase for my inconvenience."
Wayfair Canada,2019-09-22T16:08:02Z,5,Got an tv stand and hutch. Hutch had been damaged and when I took photos and chatted online with wayfair customer service they immediately issued a credit to me. Love the furniture and was able to make it work. Would definitely buy other things as their customer service is best I've ever dealt with.
Wayfair Canada,2019-09-16T17:33:01Z,1,"Shipped me the wrong item to return it was a nightmare!!! First and last order ever with this company!!!!!! 
I will never recommend not will I order from wayfair... ordered a mattress and they shipped me a furniture wall so heavy and it took me days to resolve.  How do you ship a wall instead of a mattress??!?? Lost my deal on the mattress just a complete and total nightmare"
Wayfair Canada,2019-09-16T04:04:38Z,1,"Purchased many of their pieces of decor and a console table and financed through Paybright. My order has gone through on Paybright and received their loan agreement but all the items are still sitting in my Wayfair cart. It’s as if they were not purchased. I don’t want to put the order through again for fear of being double charged, especially if the first order went through; I’m beyond frustrated because I cannot get through to customer service. I do not want to be financially tied to an agreement for 12 months and paying the monthly amount plus interest if the purchase has not even gone through!!! How can someone’s website be this broken???"
Wayfair Canada,2019-09-10T02:21:04Z,1,"the worst product i ever have recieved, i am so disappointed, damaged, looks like crap and return policy is i have to pay to return garbage they sent me,."
Wayfair Canada,2019-09-09T17:04:23Z,1,"I wish I had checked the reviews before I bought a set of dishes from Wayfair.  I ordered them August 28th, 2019.  Shipping said I would receive them On Friday, Sept. 6th.  Today, Monday Sept 9th and no delivery as yet.  I called and they searched and said the package was still in customs and they didn't know how long before I would receive it. How could it still be in customs when the tracking # says it arrived in Quebec last Wednesday and has been sitting there since then. 
I will NEVER shop Wayfair again!"
Wayfair Canada,2019-08-30T13:08:13Z,1,"Wayfair website is very misleading,products don't look the same when received!
Also,customer service is EXTREMELY poor in informing customer's, or helping with issues,and that includes speaking with supervisors. 
On top of that, I've had packages lost in transit!!
They dont seem to put their customer's first when needed most.All they care about is taking your money for an order,and beyond that,customer service is lacking,so say the least.I will shop elsewhere."
Wayfair Canada,2019-08-27T19:43:08Z,1,"It's purely a fake business that exists only on social media and/or on worldwide web. Probably three people (working from their homes in China, US & Canada) are running this business. They take orders from customers and then place the similar orders to different suppliers. These suppliers most of the time don't have stuff in their stocks or sometimes ship very late. Fake carrier's tracking numbers are provided and bogus status updates are entered online. Delivery is promised in 3 days but it never comes or arrive very very late. Customers money is used during this time and on complaints they are asked to wait and certain kinds of discounts are offered. If suppliers by chance ship the stuff they move it forward to the customers or after using customers' money for weeks they refund it back. The whole comment is based on my personal two experiences with wayfair.ca. In short, it's better to stay away from this business."
Wayfair Canada,2019-08-26T21:31:49Z,1,"I have placed an order with Wayfair.ca on August 1, 2019 for the futon sofa with the delivery on August 14, 2019. The day before the expected delivery I have contacted Wayfair customer service and the lady named Deborah E. after checking her system told me that delivery will be on time and I should wait for Fedex next day. I took a day off and that day was wasted for nothing as the delivery never happened. I have called Wayfair and they checked it again, that time my case was escalated to the supervisor Sarah. She told me that the item I have ordered is on back order and she is very sorry, she has adjusted the price for me as a compensation for the trouble for about $150 and promised the ""for sure"" delivery on August 27, 2019. On August 26, 2019 I have called Wayfair and talked to Megan, I have asked her the same question ""when my item will be delivered?"". She promised me to check with the warehouse and call me back. In an hour she left me a voice mail confirming the delivery on August 27, 2019. In an hour after I checked Wayfair website and it was saying there that the delivery will be on September 4, 2019. Sounds like Groundhog day. At this point I called Wayfair and talked to the supervisor Scotty who has transferred me to another lady who said that the item is on back order and they don't know when it will be delivered.
After so many lies and unfulfilled promises I have cancelled my order with Wayfair.
They don't know what is going on with their warehouse and because of that they are selling ""air"" or in the other words they don't have stuff they are selling.
I have wasted a month and now need to rush through local stores to find the sofa as I have guests coming in a week.
Stay away from Wayfair! They lure customers with fair pricing but behind their website is nothing but the trouble.

Wayfair Canada,2019-08-22T15:50:04Z,1,"I ordered a sectional on July 17th. After 2 weeks the delivery day is coming. The delivery team took out 2 different sectionals before realizing that none of them is mine. They inform me that they don’t have it and leave. I call the call center, they order another one and inform me that I have to wait another 2 weeks. After 3 weeks the sectional is finally scheduled for delivery. The delivery team comes and again, they tell me that they have something for me but it’s different than what I ordered (the name of the label was different than the name of the couch for my order) so they take back the couch and leave. I call again the call center that it’s telling me that that was the right couch. I tell them to send the delivery team back if they already have it. The representative is telling me that she won’t send them back because I should have took it in that moment. I told her that it would have been impossible to take the couch against the delivery team will. It was not like I would have grab it and run on the stairs with it. I explain that this is the 2nd time when I ask vacantion from work just to receive the couch and the 3rd time it’s really not possible so I insist to bring me back the couch. The lady is transferring me to the delivery department where I try to explain again what happened. The lady from there was not interested in my situation, I had the feeling that she was not even listening what I was saying. I was asking a question and the answer was “aham, go on”. Bad customer service and unprofessional. I’m never going to try this again."
Wayfair Canada,2019-08-22T14:16:31Z,1,"Very poor customer service. I ordered 2 sofas one month back. When they delivered the sofa, one of the sofas was of the wrong color. After 10 days of the complaint, when they come to replace the wrong sofa, the replacement was also of the wrong color. I don't know how many days they will take now. I also had a bad experience in the past as well. I purchased a divider and when it reached me, it was already damaged."

They agreed to replace by taking the broken part from a complete bench in stock to expedite it, but needing 10 days even just to send it out. From current stock of 7. It did not ship on time. I complained. They now will re-order the entire bench. BUT they sent me a link to having ordered the wrong size and wrong final finish of bench. Will I now get the wrong size, and start this nonsense all over again?? I found them very slow to respond; I thought they have givcen inappropriate and inattentive responses."

Wayfair Canada,2019-07-10T00:03:07Z,1,"I ordered a yellow and blue bathroom vanity and received a solid white one. Weeks after I expected the delivery.  Then the scheduled delivery time messed up, so they rescheduled for the next day.  Then it was late. Late again.

Two people in our house missed a day and a half of work.  Crystal, the service rep, refused to even acknowledge that the photo was a gross misrepresentation of the product. Instead she insisted that myself, my partner, and two delivery drivers could not distinguish yellow or blue  from white. Even after being told I would accept the delivery and pay if only she presented me with respect and honesty.

She apologized for the fact that I was mistaken and processed the return. My kids are still brushing their teeth in the kitchen sink.

Horrid."

Wayfair Canada,2019-06-20T23:50:35Z,5,"I've only ordered once from wayfair, but I had no issues with it whatsoever. The item got delivered on the day that they said it would. I ordered a litterbox enclosure; I thought the price was fair and it's a great looking piece of furniture."
Wayfair Canada,2019-06-11T22:49:11Z,2,Contacted customer support via email to get correct tracking info. Amy T couldn’t find it and escalated but I was asked to wait two business days for answers. It was supposed to be here today and they have no idea where it is. Cancelled the order via telephone which was easy and the only reason they get two stars. Will NEVER order from Wayfair.ca again. They even offered 10% off my next order. Why would I use them again when they couldn’t get it right the first time? They would have been smarter to offer a discount on the order I already placed that they couldn’t deliver on time.
Wayfair Canada,2019-05-28T18:48:29Z,1,Won't be ordering from this site again. you should really notify the CUSTOMER of the cancellation process with some sort of a time period. I had cancelled an item 12 hrs later and since you DON'T check your business on the weekends the cancellation doesn't get processed. You reps blame it on the supplier BUT it's your website that we order from??!!
Wayfair Canada,2019-05-18T11:42:18Z,5,"Wonderful customer service.  We order a pool table (of all things!) but were not happy with the quality of it. We immediately took pics of the few imperfections on the table and sent them to Wayfair.  Without hesitation , they asked what we would like: exchange the table?, full refund?, discount? Whatever we wanted.  We took a few days to think about it (we were actually in shock of not having to fight with them) When we called them to advise,they put us in contact with the delivery company to arrange a date for pick up. We did not even have to dismantle it!  this was just too easy.  We then thought...OMG how are we going to get our money back?  We checked our credit card on line and saw that the day we told them we wanted to return it....they credited our credit card....they didn`t even have the table back yet!  I was sooo impressed.  Now, Wayfair is the first place I look for anything!"
Wayfair Canada,2019-05-17T19:48:31Z,1,"Buyer Beware. I highly recommend you review the multitude of complaints below and notice the pattern.  In case you haven't noticed, Wayfair's advertising and promises of quick delivery have become ubiquitous. Everywhere we turn we see Wayfair. It has become obvious that the company is trying to grab a share of the home delivery market. We were also fooled by these promises and as a result, we thought we would try Wayfair as a means to avoid having to drive to a storefront and shop. We ordered five distinct items. 

Everything that was relayed to us regarding delivery details was dishonest. Items that were going to arrive in just a few days kept getting pushed further and further back with no concrete information ever being available. This meant we had to take time off, unnecessarily stay at home, and postpone other activities based on Wayfair's BS. As a result, we cancelled our five orders.

In a nut shell, they get you in the door and hook you with their promises of short delivery times and seemingly good prices but then go on to shaft you with inadequate follow through as they drag out delivery dates. 

And then after we phoned and cancelled our orders on the phone with the Wayfair agent and after we told our order was cancelled, a week or so later Fedex started showing up dropping off parcels we already cancelled. One was left in the rain outside of our gate close to the roadway. On two other occasions we sent Fedex away telling them we had cancelled. Fedex would sneak back and drop the parcels off when we were not at home. What a friggen gong show Wayfair has created. Never again! 

With same day delivery service about to be offered by Amazon, I am not sure how this place stays in business."
Wayfair Canada,2019-05-16T18:56:38Z,1,Horrible! Unusable products and horrible return policy. Requires you to provide pictures of defects and answer several questions and then on top of it they want you to dispose of it. How am I supposed to dispose of a huge piece of furniture? What a horrible business! Rude online customer service.
Wayfair Canada,2019-05-03T16:09:27Z,1,"Very poor experience with Wayfair!! Would not buy from them ever. 
Tried to order a 9x12 carpet, first it was on backorder for 2 months then they advertise ""FREE shipping"" on orders over $150..(mine was $950) when I put in my postal got a message can't deliver to that area. After 6 weeks of phone calls and emails I gave up. My neighbor, same postal code was able to get a carpet in October delivered right to her door at NO Charge! They even went so far as to tell me they would deliver to my remote area (southeastern BC) for $350...ya kidding me! Not the north pole folks."
Wayfair Canada,2019-05-03T16:00:48Z,2,"Keep in mind I haven't even received the desk I ordered yet and it may be wonderful and on time. If you hate ads as much as I do, do not even visit their website. I bought a desk and now I see ads for that exact desk I have already bought on EVERY SINGLE OTHER WEBSITE I VISIT NOW. It's on my facebook, it's on both my emails, it's on google, it's on porn sites, it's on my freaking Pokemon scanning app.I only ordered it two days ago and I am fed up of being spammed with their advertising, especially for something I have already purchased. 

I should have known better. My ex sent my a link for a couch she was going to buy around January and they spammed me after that too. The amount of money they spend on advertising will ensure I never visit their site again."
Wayfair Canada,2019-04-24T21:28:18Z,2,"I'm another one of those people who used to order and get free shipping.  Now they've decided that my town of approx. 10,000 people is ""out of their free delivery area""......even though we're not that far from one of the biggest cities in Canada.  No more Wayfair for me.  When I add shipping costs, the prices are no longer reasonable.  The people I talked to were nice.....the new policy isn't."
Wayfair Canada,2019-04-24T17:24:36Z,1,"My husband and I ordered what we thought was a table and chairs, when it arrived it was only the table.  The description says seating for 4 but does not say chairs not included nor does it direct you to a site to purchase the chairs.  When we called to return it they did not tell us that someone had to be at the house for it to be picked up - no one had to be there for them to drop it off.  When I explained that we both work, they just said that then we would have to find a FedEx site to take it to.  The table weighs about 100 lbs I don't think I will be carrying it into FedEx, my husband and I could barely lift it to get it into the house and find out that it was wrong.  So sad and disappointed in this company and their staff.  We ordered the table as are moving and downsizing, we move this Friday, little to say we have no table and chairs now and still not sure how we are going to get it returned."
Wayfair Canada,2019-04-22T18:37:00Z,1,"Buyer beware.  Especially Wayfair Professional clients for Canada.   They cannot deliver during business hours.   You will need to Incur overtime for you employees to wait for the carrier AMJ who will only call the day before  after holding onto your product for almost two weeks.  

Needless to say. Ordered the product over a month ago. Out over $6,600 and never got.  Now going through the disastrous return procedure of a product I never received. 

Neither party could care less.  Wayfair or AMJ.  Too bad so sad you are unhappy.  Next customer please"
Wayfair Canada,2019-04-20T21:07:49Z,1,"If you are getting items shipped and delivered in Halifax, DON’T. Save yourself the headache. I ordered a bed frame, and I set up a time with dispatchers at AMJ for a certain day between the hours of 9am-1pm. It was 12:30pm when I decided to call and make sure they were coming because I hadn’t heard anything.... I called AMJ Halifax and Sandra said that they are on their way and they’ll be at my house before 1pm. That was not the case. It’s 1pm and still nothing. I called back and spoke with Al (said he’s a manager, no way could/should be a manager) he was rude, inconsiderate and had NO respect for me or my time. I explain to him that I am now late for work, I allotted for this time (mind you they have a 4 hour window to deliver) and I am now frustrated. He proceeds to explain that they are running behind schedule and that they should be at my house SOON. I asked how long “soon” meant and he couldn’t tell me.... anyways, I couldn’t wait any longer as I was late for work, so I asked Al to tell the drivers to come after 5pm, he said ok and that he would arrange that. I get to work at 1:30 and receive a call at 1:41pm, the drivers are at my house. Al didn’t tell them NOT to come, and he didn’t reschedule them for 5pm...
This was a disappointing experience with Wayfair, and the way I was treated was unacceptable and I will never purchase from Wayfair AGAIN if they use AMJ delivery services (or whatever they’re called) for Halifax, NS."
Wayfair Canada,2019-04-18T16:19:56Z,3,"My first time to order from wayfair.And I can say I am very satisfied of their service.The product came 1 day late from the date it was expected but I don't mind,I got my order in good shape and good quality.I am still waiting for another item that I ordered and hoping to get it on the date that they mentioned.Thank you wayfair"
Wayfair Canada,2019-04-18T00:35:23Z,2,"Just finished talking with waifair customer service for the 3rd time in a month. First time I called to ask them to send hardware for the item they had delivered as it was missing from the box. Okay experience and they promised they would ship the hardware. Was it happy as I had to wait another week to get it... But it never arrived... Wife called to check and they said they could not figure out what happened, gave her a small discount and said they will ship the hardware again... And a week later it did not arrive... So I called and was told it was shipped but the service agent could not figure out where it is. Put me on hold Nd came back saying warehouse is closed and that someone will call me to advise on the status of the order... But they could not promise when I would get the call.. I said forget it and wanted to return it but the process of doing it, as explained to me by the customer service person (who was polite and all), seemed quite cumbersome... So I decided to wait and see if I indeed do get a call back and wayfair can sort this out... But judging by the negative reviews here my hopes are not very high... Should have done some research before we decided to try wayfair. And this will likely be our one and only try... Two weeks later I did get the hardware but it involved several more phone calls to waifair and Loomis (company waifair paid to deliver the product) and only a couple more broken promises...."
Wayfair Canada,2019-04-12T17:31:55Z,4,"I’ve had good experiences with Wayfair when I went in without high expectations. Ordered off them multiple times and have always been happy with the products, while they can take awhile to deliver.
They very obviously use aggressive advertising techniques and do whatever it takes to reel you in to make a purchase.
Their sales are usually just tactics to get you to make a purchase. The sale price is seems to be what the item is actually worth. 
As someone else has mentioned, they advertise free 1 day shipping, then change the delivery day to a week after you’ve already gone thru the ordering process. 
That being said I’ve ordered a comforter off them that ripped the first time going thru the wash and their customer service representative gave me a full refund after only one email. That was my first purchase and that’s why I’ve continued to order off them. 
Just don’t expect quality service when you’re ordering from a discount furniture website."
Wayfair Canada,2019-04-12T13:24:19Z,1,"I used Wayfair for the first time in August last year when I ordered two beds for my kids. Both were delivered damaged. It was a very lengthy and frustrating process to get the damaged items replaced but eventually it was done. I decided to give them another try this year. The headboard I ordered was delivered damaged, the desk I ordered was delivered damaged and I am still awaiting delivery on 2 more items. So far I have yet to receive something from Wayfair that is not damaged. The replacement process is frustrating and they keep changing the expected date that the replacement items will be delivered. Don’t make the same mistake I did by believing that receiving your goods damaged is an exception. At Wayfair it is the rule."
Wayfair Canada,2019-04-11T19:04:28Z,1,"I loved Wayfair until they decided to charge for shipping. It was the whole idea to not pay for shipping.  I understand that UPS and Fedex is charging a surcharge to deliver to my small town of approximately 3,000 plus. The buck gets put onto the consumer as usual and I am not going to pay it so unfortunately it ends my shopping relationship with Wayfair.  Will spend my hard earned dollars where I can get a good deal."
Wayfair Canada,2019-04-11T15:05:47Z,2,"Ordered a coffee table off of Wayfair.ca...all the way through the ordering process it said ""order this item within the next 16 hours to receive free 1-day shipping.  So I ordered it right then and there as we really need a coffee table. I went to check out, added my address and still says ""this order qualifies for free 1-day shipping, receive it Friday April 12"".  As soon as I confirm the order and they had my money, I get an email saying my order will arrive April 17...that's a WEEK not 1-DAY...so I contacted Wayfair and they said ""well the item is coming from the US so we can't guarantee any shipping date"" which is complete BS since I ordered it from wayfair.ca not Wayfair.com so this ""it's coming from the US"" is an unacceptable answer. They already knew they were shipping from the US to Canada before I completed my order. I found this whole situation to be very misleading.  Right up until the moment they actually had my money I was getting free 1-day shipping.  They take my money and suddenly that is no longer.  Lying to your customers isn't the way to keep customers.  This will be my first and only purchase from Wayfair.  I will never purchase from them again."
Wayfair Canada,2019-04-11T10:24:25Z,5,Amazing products. Exceptional customer service. When I received a damaged item customer service responded immediate and made arrangements that were more than fair. Just placed a $2200 order. Love Wayfair.ca
Wayfair Canada,2019-04-10T04:02:15Z,5,this company is very fair I have been dealing with them for a few years now............something not suitable just return it with no hassle at all.
Wayfair Canada,2019-04-09T17:04:34Z,3,"I have purchased many items from Wayfair.ca and it always came with free shipping anytime my order was over $75, now all of a sudden I am being charged for shipping.  I was told it was only for specific items so I kept adding random items to my cart and the shipping keeps getting bigger and bigger.  Its false advertising, they should change the words in their commercial jingle."
Wayfair Canada,2019-03-29T16:54:02Z,5,I Love Wayfair - they are an amazing company and their customer service is fabulous ! I have bought furniture and other items from them and am very pleased with the products. They have many things on sale as well.
Wayfair Canada,2019-03-22T12:05:55Z,1,"Never ever I will use this company - Wayfair Canada. Before you buy something they are very polite with you, but when item is paid and delivered they avoid any contacts with you and do not answer your E-mails. I bought Outsunny 10 x 10 gazebo by Aosom XAO01711. It was advertised that mosquito netting and privacy curtains included but after boxes were opened I found only privacy curtains, no mosquito netting. Also there is no instruction manual for assembling this gazebo and it is very difficult to understand how to start to set up the gazebo. I E-mailed Wayfair several times asking to let me know where can I get assembling instruction, but never received any replies ."
Wayfair Canada,2019-03-21T15:25:30Z,1,"the price discrimination is beyond your imagination, for something.priced 29.99 on wayfair.com you have to pay 69.99 canadian with wayfair.ca. I spend few hours to compare the prices between wayfair.com and .ca and noticed the huge price differences are really not reasonable"
Wayfair Canada,2019-03-20T17:54:03Z,1,"I bought a sofa-bed 19 Feb, free shipping. I only received it 12 March, almost one month later (Total $767.06). Today, 20 March, I'm trying to return it because the sofa is really hard, not comfy at all. But they are charging me $111. This is insane! I was expecting a fee, but not that much. So, if you're planning to buy something like that online, or even mattress, DON'T BUY IT! You'll lose money! Go to a physical store to try it or always chose places that allow you to test it first. It was my first order, it will be my last one."
Wayfair Canada,2019-03-19T15:00:02Z,1,"This is the 2nd time this has happened...My mother and I have ordered many items at Wayfair.ca and it was always free shipping when the total is over $75.  For some reason, every time we go to make another purchase a few months later, it says:  This postal code is outside our normal delivery zone, and we are unable to offer free shipping, which is false, as we both live in the same area and it was always delivered free shipping before.  I was getting ready to order quite a few items as we will be doing some big renovations this year, but if this is not fixed for good....we'll be doing our shopping with other companies and tell our friends and family as well. Thank you !!  ****Received a reply from Wayfair today March 19, 2019 by email and they will NOT fix it...Somehow our postal code is NOT in their FREE delivery area anymore...I'll spread the word out to all our friends and family to make sure they are aware of the NEW shipping charges and false advertising....We are now April 16, 2019 and they still will not fix the postal code problem...It's stupid because if I cross our town bridge then it's free and I am not even 1/4 mile away LOL"
Wayfair Canada,2019-03-17T22:15:16Z,1,"Horrible customer service- no transparency 

Prices are inflated and they do not deliver without incidence of damage.  Additionally they don't delivery on time.

Buyer beware better to go to a reputable shop in your neighbourhood before rolling the dice on wayfair.

Wayfair does not deserve Canadian's business custom.
Run!!!!"
Wayfair Canada,2019-02-26T18:06:13Z,5,"I'm totally confused by all the bad reviews of Wayfair. It looks like Wayfair may be getting a bad rap for issues beyond their control.

We're redecorating and over the past year I've probably purchased 2 dozen items from Wayfair. We've found the selection, value and customer service to be amazing. Totally recommend."
Wayfair Canada,2019-02-24T03:25:34Z,5,"So far I have only made a few orders through Wayfair. I am very pleased with the product. The ease of use for their website and the quick delivery. I intend to continue to order from Wayfair when the need arises. The only negative is, I could do without the multitude of emails. Way too many. One or two a week would be more than sufficient. Ease up guys. I haven't forgotten you! I'll be back for more! 😁"
Wayfair Canada,2019-02-22T23:42:26Z,1,Ordered a 4 gallon hot water tank they had advertised for 70% off.  A few days later received an email that it was a price error and cancelled my order and removed the product.  They should be honoring the advertised price be it a mistake or not.  Will not be shopping here again.
Wayfair Canada,2019-02-22T03:07:26Z,1,"Sorry, but this may well be my first and last purchase from wayfair. I have now missed three days of work waiting to get the delivery.  Weather has been fine enough everyone else is delivering fine. And Fedex has been absolutely atrocious. I will literally boycott wayfair based on having this terrible company serving them. My purchase was over 600 dollars and promised for the 20th with was over a week wait. And I've had nothing but headache between wayfair and fedex. If it's not here tomorrow guarenteed return and I'll take my money elsewhere."
Wayfair Canada,2019-02-17T17:45:21Z,3,"Bought a couch a few months ago(September), one of the 9 year old kids sat on it yesterday and we heard crack, we looked at the bottom because something didn't look or feel right,..so we opened the sheathing to see on the bottom, and whole thing is made from scrap wood or Clearly a second or third grade (if there is such thing) wood . theres still dried scrap bark on some of the splintering wood as well as the stapled wood on the joint is suspect, with no wood screws or bracketing  at all . Yes it was a deal all right. But it's not when I think I'm going to have to rebuild the damn wood frame of the couch somehow with something to support the crap workmanship. I won't be buying from them again. I've got all kinds of pictures  I'm trying to find a site to host it so I can show the absolute ridiculousness of it.

Follow up : Wayfair contacted us and gave us choice of a new couch or a refund . They were fair and straight forward. So we are exchanging the couch out in March , we still are going to have to look under it to see if we get the same issues."
Wayfair Canada,2019-02-14T19:35:16Z,5,"They have very good sales!!! 
They deliver before the time!!!"
Wayfair Canada,2019-02-13T19:50:44Z,5,"Wayfair, I will give you full marks even thought the product I bought was defective from manufacturer. I fixed it with black tape, but it was a let down to see the legs defective/cracked from a fair decent quality printer cart
Apon second look ,the packaging box does show a small amount of damage to one corner, and as the parcel had to go through some very cold temps, it could be a shock crack"
Wayfair Canada,2019-02-09T16:24:03Z,1,"Terrible service. We were told we could return the couch if we did not like it. We receive the couch and it feels like you’re sitting on cardboard. If you don’t sit in the middle of the cusion you will be even less comfy. We paid 413$+tax which they have now said they will be taking delivery out of to return the item. Which I have no problem with, except that when we got to the checkout it says credit of 326$ deducted 88.64$ for return delivery fees. Ridiculous and terrible product. Will not be buying from them ever again. #2546672901"
Wayfair Canada,2019-02-07T00:52:55Z,5,"Area rug came a day early, on the day of an ice storm to be exact, I was able to track my order each day & had 2 updates a day as to where my order was. No issues at all with Wayfair or Fed Ex. I'd recommend them."
Wayfair Canada,2019-02-05T21:46:34Z,1,Its so annoying that I cant get the english version. French comes up and there is nowhere to change it to english.
Wayfair Canada,2019-02-02T16:00:09Z,1,"Absolutely do not recommend this website.

Products are as low quality as it can get for the price you're paying. (I'm guessing this is how some people/companies make millions? By overpricing and delivering garbage products to consumers.)

Ratings on the website are absolutely inaccurate except for the 1 star ratings.

Why would you pay for something that you can't see and touch in person? (I was dumb enough to, out of ""convenience"".)

I wrote a few reviews for a dining set I ordered, it got deleted every single time. (I guess descriptive bad reviews get deleted, while 5star descriptive reviews are kept?)

That just means all the 5 star reviews are no longer credible anymore, because they could just be all fake reviews.

BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK."
Wayfair Canada,2019-02-02T10:52:10Z,1,"While shopping on Wayfair for a rug, I suddenly realized I was connected to Rugs.ca .  I continued to shop thinking Wayfair has an association with this company & as you see by my Wayfair purchases, I am a big fan of Wayfair & if Wayfair likes them, I'll like them.  Well that is so far from the truth !  Long story short...ordered a rug that ' looked ' good on the sight ( on sale for $ 250.00, 1/2 price from $500.00 ).  Ordered it & it arrived very quickly but the rug was of poor quality & no where near Wayfair's standards !  Needless to say I returned the rug with all its upsetting & frustrating bureaucracy & was charged  $ 75.00 for the return & my efforts !! Can you rectify this ? This is a ' Rip ' !  Drop Rugs.ca !!   R.F."
Wayfair Canada,2019-01-30T23:58:04Z,1,"Honestly the biggest mistake of my life to even bother with this company. First time user today and now i'm left with moving this weekend and unable to go and get furniture elsewhere since i'm waiting for this pathetic excuse of a company to determine whether my order was ACTUALLY placed or not. Worse still? I had my order done via their finance partner...the finance company think the order has gone through successfully but 2 Wayfair people told me the order definitely didn't complete from the Wayfair side. Now a 3rd one has told me ""oh it could be 24-48hrs before the order is confirmed and shows in your online account on our website""...so what? In the meantime i'm liable for the financial agreement for not receiving a damn thing furniture-wise. Avoid this place COMPLETELY. Even if the error when completing the final bit of the order once my financing was secured IS sorted out I sure as hell will not be re-submitting the order again. Looking forward to keeping all my belongings in boxes until you can fathom the mess you've created Wayfair. If your financing partner even attempts to take my money for items NOT successfully ordered, I will happily be following up with my lawyer. Seriously, just go to Ikea or a junk store and actually get something for your money.

Update 8th Feb: supposedly this had been resolved??OF COURSE IT HASN'T BEEN BECAUSE YOUR SUBSIDIARIES AND YOU CLEARLY DON'T TALK. Check your customer service inbox for yet another email to you to sort this mess out properly. Beyond incompetent. I'm now getting harassing text messages every 10 seconds saying Paybright is trying to take money for the finance off my card? What the actual hell? Genuinely in shock and tears."
Wayfair Canada,2019-01-30T03:16:37Z,5,"Seriously one of the most impressive companies to purchase from.  I have ordered lots of different things for our house remodel.  When something is out of stock you can set up a notification for when it is available again.  We had a table arrive slightly damaged, they refunded our money right away and told us to either throw away the table or donate it.  It saved the hassle of sending something back that they can't sell anyways.  

Their reviews are reliable.  

If a product doesn't have all of the specs listed that you want if you contact customer service they look up the manual for the product and find out the information for it.  They then update the listing for others to see the newly added information. 

They do not deserve the low star rating that they have on here, however most people do write a review when they are upset with something."
Wayfair Canada,2019-01-26T05:37:50Z,1,"I ordered a sectional sofa on Dec.26, 18. It arrived in BC, Canada. Got a phone call from the delivery company Cascadia Distribution. Spoke to their agent to set up 4-8 pm delivery for Jan. 22. Jan 21 around 4 pm I got a confirmation email from wayfair the delivery is 9-1. No one contacted me or provide me any explanation. So the driver showed up on Jan 22 morning when no one is at home. Called wayfair client service on Jan 22 and they put me back to the incompetent delivery company again and reschedule for Jan 24 4-8 pm. I got another wayfair email on Jan 23 around 4 pm to tellme the delivery time is Jan 24 8-12. It’s so pathetic. Both wayfair and it’s delivery partner have no respect to the customer. They should not be in business. Oh yeah the so called case manager assigned to my purchase “disappeared”. I have to go online to request the refund for the sofa I never received. What a joke. Wayfair must think they are such a big company so they can do whatever they want. I learned my lesson I should have shopped locally. Wayfair = no customer service."
Wayfair Canada,2019-01-18T17:34:40Z,5,"Ordered two nightstands recently and overall had a great experience. The item was originally out of stock, so I signed up to receive an alert. A few weeks later, it came back in stock and I was notified via my app (opted-in) and through email. I ordered it right away and it arrived in two shipments. One arrived 2 days ago, and the other arrived yesterday. The first nightstand was flawless, but the second nightstand had some damage to one of the corners of the nightstand top. 

I took a picture and emailed last night with the info and this morning received a reply from an associate there with the options to resolve the issue. First option was to receive a refund and repair the damage/defect myself, second was to receive a replacement top for the nightstand and third, return this one and receive a new one completely. 

I opted for the first choice because I feel it is the most economical and environmentally friendly option. It's wonderful that Wayfair is willing to ship out a new part or even replace the entire nightstand, but the side effects of that on the environment are enormous! 

Anyway, I applaud Wayfair for their quick response and resolution to my situation. Great customer service."
Wayfair Canada,2019-01-18T08:47:03Z,1,"This is more of a check your account situation... I had previously ordered two items from wayfair, a bedframe and a cat scratching tree. Both were delivered before or on their delivery date and was the brand, size and colour expected.

However, my warning is of the website security.  My wayfair.ca account was hacked and someone used my saved information to try and purchase a 500.00 gift card.  They were able to change my email address to something different in hopes I wouldn't notice or get an email reciept, well it was the wayfair email of change of information that caught my attention. My suggestion is that perhaps wayfair should not save credit card  information or have you have to add some passcode or confirmation  or something so accounts can't be used for fraudulent purposes because once your password and email has been changed you're esentailly locked out of your own account to whatever the person changed it too.  I have now lost my faith in wayfair security after having to deal with this."

On one or two occasions they have shipped the wrong item, or had a small amount of damage, but they have rectified the situation immediately and promptly and to my satisfaction 100%. I have received courteous and quick customer service as well . I enjoy shopping with Wayfair and will continue to do so into the future!"
Wayfair Canada,2018-12-28T21:01:50Z,1,"I ordered a pool table at the beginning of December with the estimated delivery date of Dec 20th and the expected delivery date of Dec 27. I found out that it was not delivered yesterday (Dec 27th) and will not be delivered (for another 12 to 14 days) until next year in January and too late for our New Years holiday party.

When I tracked the item - it was shipped (from the province next door) all the way across North America to California leaving me with nothing. Makes absolutely no sense at all.

This is clearly not a Canadian company - only a US company would ship the item from the province next door, completely across the country to California for no apparent reason.

I am very disappointed that adequate service could not be provided and will happily look for another company that knows something as simple as how to ship items."
Wayfair Canada,2018-12-25T22:17:49Z,1,"Update 28 Dec: my partner submitted her complaint and was given a refund. So fair enough. On that front. 

Of note, after some research, we learned that the one we received was indeed some 40% cheaper then the one she ordered and paid for. So still of concern, obviously, and refund or not, is my original point about the product switch, for which no explanation was offered either here or in private correspondence.  

So, Wayfair, if someone orders X from you and yet receives Y -- a conveniently similar, but cheaper, and completely differently coded, item, and from a completely different company than the one originally listed -- then how is this NOT still cause to doubt you and your business model? It's not just about a refund. It's about smelling a scam and/or incompetence: YOU are the broker between buyers and manufacturers/distributors -- that is your business model -- and nothing in your response here (or in most of the other posts I'm reading) suggests actual accountability. 

Bottom line: happy for her refund? Naturally. Still distrust Wayfair in the sense that I think this has probably happened to others and will go right on happening? Yep. 



My partner bought a fireplace from you the first week of Dec for Christmas:. for me. Well, Merry Christmas to me... because Wayfair sent a much smaller fireplace that just also happens to be the same unique color (white), ""conveniently,"" and one that is therefore cheaper than the one she paid for. It's not even from the same company or brand she initially ordered from and paid for, for crying out loud.  

I smell a scam: ""Oh jeez, let's send this smaller, cheaper one and maybe nobody will notice.... And of course since it's a gift, it won't get opened and checked until Xmas, and maybe nobody will care."" This of thing doesn't happen by ""accident"" when we're talking two completely different products from two different companies with, ergo, two completely different product codes. Indeed, how could it ""accidentally"" have been selected? 

We will be looking for either: a/the right product to be sent, with expedited shipping, NOW, as soon as the wrong item has been put in the post; or b/ a complete refund as soon as the item is in the post, and not this ”store credits” garbage. One thing I can tell you is absolutely we're NOT paying a dime in return shipping fees. 

Somehow, after reading all of the reviews of late here, I'm not shocked by any of this."

Wayfair Canada,2018-12-21T17:57:27Z,1,"I ordered a desk chair for my daughter for Christmas. It supposedly shipped on Dec 11th at the same time as another purchase from them. I received the other item and assumed it was just taking a little longer for the chair. Yesterday I looked at the actual tracking and it says it was ready for shipping as of Dec 7th! When I called Customer Service today (the rep was actually very pleasant and really did try to help) I found out it was showing that it never left the warehouse, and here's the kicker...now there are no more in stock! So why didn't I get a notification so I could have gone out and bought my daughter another chair for Christmas??? I'm so very disappointed. I honestly hope I can find a replacement in time for Christmas."
Wayfair Canada,2018-12-21T00:05:41Z,1,"We purchased a table and chairs and received them quickly but when we opened it up the table was broken.  The customer service was decent and the told us to keep the one we got and that they send another one.  When we received the second one it was broken as well. Now we're stuck with two that we somehow have to dispose of (because of our bylaws we're going to have to pay to dispose of them.).

Edit.  They say that I've been credited and yes I'm getting my money back but I dont have a product and now I have to cmgo out of my pocket to get the two broken ones taken away."
Wayfair Canada,2018-12-19T15:58:05Z,5,"May be certain clients have a bad experience with Wayfair but not me. No damage in the deliveries of what I have ordered. With furniture, I had somebody experienced to put together the pieces but no problems to put them together.
But what did surprise me was the response to my complain that the order of sheets where replaced by duvet covers. Wayfair offered right a way,either to replace the item or give me full reimbursement. No arguing. Very fast they did it. It gave me back the confidence to continue business with the company."
Wayfair Canada,2018-12-16T01:27:45Z,5,I need to say this because I really believe we need to give kudos to a company when they are awesome. Not only if they do something wrong. Wayfair  (Wayfair.ca) This shout out is to you. My wife and I just got off the phone with Ed( Please  make sure he's aware of our satisfaction) from your support team. We had a few concerns and he addressed them in a very impressive manner. Speaks volumes in regards to the company's values. We appreciate having done business with you. We will shop on your site again. (In fact we just did order something) Thank you.
Wayfair Canada,2018-12-14T03:01:55Z,1,"I recently purchased a prep table by Rebrillant which was described as stainless steel.  The box stated that is was Manufactured by Trinity imported by Costco. The table wasn’t stainless steel steel as it was lightweight, magnets didn’t adher and it scratches easily.  I suspect it is low quality aluminum.  I received a 30% discount and kept the table to avoid further inconvenience.

Wayfair Canada,2018-12-03T14:09:08Z,1,"We have placed several orders on Wayfair's website now and have yet to have a positive experience.
Our latest order was for 2 throw pillows. Before Wayfair put all accent pillows on sale, we order these 2 accent pillows that said ""Hurry, only 5 left in stock"". After we ""hurried"" and placed our order, we received a delayed shipment e-mail due to the product being out of stock.
I then received an e-mail from Wayfair regarding their accent pillow sale, and the pillows we ordered were on sale and in stock. I called their customer service, who were obviously well trained in how to empathize with a client, and she said she would check with the wharehouse in Texas and get back to me within 2 business days. Well, we never received an e-mail or call.
Now the pillows are still on sale and still the same ""Hurry on 3 left in stock"", and we just received another e-mail with a further delay of our order until next year."

I have contacted wayfair asking for the current tracking location and they would not provide it.  They just told me it would be delivered in 2 days.  After 4 further days passed, still no desk and no further communication from wayfair.

After getting no satisfaction from their customer service, I was forced to request a refund.  Still no reply, and I will be forced to dispute the charges on my credit card.

There should be quality control and checks to ensure items shipped to the customers are the correct items they ordered and paid for. This is very disappointing to say the least!

Wayfair Canada,2018-11-26T15:26:49Z,5,"This review is mainly focused on the customer experience.

The ordering of the product was very easy and delivery was quick.

Customer service:
We received the wrong version of the product ordered, however, the customer service provided around this was exceptional. No arguing or debating facts and came up with a satisfactory solution immediately. Friendly demeanor and apologetic from the get-go.
People, and companies, make mistakes, it is how they remedy these situations that I feel is the real test, and Wayfair excelled."

Ended up cancelling the order and decided to  order the same dresser from Wayfair. They use FedEx and it was delivered two days later, a full three days before the estimated delivery date. It was awesome. 

Ive ordered from Wayfair before and both times had no problems. It may cost a little more but well worth it imho to get delivery asap."
Wayfair Canada,2018-10-20T15:46:06Z,1,"Absolutely one of the worst companies for customer service. They see that you are interested in a product and email you a sale price, then when you try to order at that price the sale is suddenly over or that is the American price. Don't bother trying to phone because you get told they will call back but never do or get directed to the survey in the middle of your call. I spent over 90 minutes calling getting cut off and calling back never to get any satisfaction. Even after emailing them the actual email they sent me they said they had never emailed me!!!! 
Don't bother with this company not worth your time .
I see they want a confirmation number what confirmation number I was never given one typical"
Wayfair Canada,2018-10-17T19:56:17Z,1,We have placed many orders over the last several months.  Some items were returned.  We are have a problem that we cannot reconcile payments against orders.  You can place an order for many items.  A subset of those items may get shipped and you pay only for the subset.  Except that there is no documentation anywhere breaking down exactly what the payment was for.  So you are expected to puzzle it out yourself.  We have talked to the office numerous times and just are frustrated that we cannot get proper details.  Surely when wayfair bills me they should be able to provide evidence as to what the payment was for
Wayfair Canada,2018-10-04T19:13:08Z,1,"dont shop with them! thats all i have to tell you. 
they are so disorganized. so careless. so rude. They dont deserve your business.

never again!"
Wayfair Canada,2018-10-04T05:35:24Z,1,"Incredibly frustrated first time shopper. We ordered a fireplace/TV stand. When it was delivered, the damage was incredible. Took about 10 minutes to get a replacement ordered but then we were told to 'donate' the damaged unit to someone. This is a huge box (over 120 lbs) plus a smaller box for the insert. The new order arrived within a week or so. Both, the box and the fireplace inside were in an appalling shape, with chips, dents and imprints from other pieces on every piece of wood we took out of the box. I am shocked they actually continue to sell this product. 

I called for a refund which was a fairly pain-free process but we asked them to have these boxes picked up. Each time I spoke with a service rep they were polite but always said someone will be in touch. I called 2 times to follow up and each time I was told someone will be in touch within 24 hours. Not so. I always had to call them. 

Ultimately I got an email telling me they can't pick it up and gave me a link to a company that can pick up household stuff. Unfortunately they also charge for the pick up service! I did not sign up for that. I did not spend 2 weeks waiting for 2 fireplaces just to have to dispose of 300 lbs of rubbish on behalf of Wayfair. 

A number of calls and emails into it, I have had it. As I said to the rep, I just want to be like the singing, laughing and dancing people on the commercials soooo excited about a product they just bought from Wayfair. But apparently that's not going to happen.

I have already received more than 1 'we are so sorry to hear...' email so I would like the next email or call I get to be the one telling me when someone will pick up the monster of a box that is sitting in my living room as there is no storage in our apartment. It won't fit in my car, I don't know any more people who want a badly damaged fireplace and I don't want to rent a truck to take it to a dump. 

Dear Wayfair, please don't ship me rubbish and expect me to dispose of big boxes weighing several hundred pounds and tell me you feel my pain. Please come pick up these boxes. Thank you."

The order sign up indicated it would take less time to ship then final shipping time shown. Then the day the order is supposed to have shipped by no update at all I call there support line and am advised the warehouse is closed they will create a case file and call me back by the same time.next day, no update again. Called back, went through the hassle again and a day after the order was to be shipped, the day before I needed it to arive, am advised that this product is now on back order and more won't be coming in until november. Cancelled order, will never go through this company again, and recommend greatly that you avoid doing so as well."
Wayfair Canada,2018-09-27T18:25:11Z,2,"Mixed emotions,

One product came and we had no issues whatsoever with it. Beautiful, prompt, inexpensive, great quality......
Another product has so many issues, missing screws, missing leg, damaged table top, faulty chairs, delayed delivery, delayed delivery delayed.......it goes on.....I'm waiting over a month for my dining table to be sorted. They are good in a way they offer money off every time you ring them with a complaint, my dining set is half off at this stage but I shouldn't have to go through this. 

I think the problem Wayfair has is whoever they're sourcing some of their stuff off is just below quality and then they jack the price up, they should have better quality control, and do something about your warehouse, they work at a glacial pace and don't seem too fussed about actually shipping replacement stuff out. 
If the warehouse had customers shouting down the phone asking where their stuff is I'd bet they wouldn't be so complacent in their speed......just a thought.

Customer services is good though, they are apologetic and try to be as helpful as best they can be.
Just their shipping problems and quality control is really letting them down."
Wayfair Canada,2018-09-21T19:32:44Z,3,"Some of the wayfair prices seem too good to be true, and that's probably because they cut costs/corners in other areas to make up the difference. FedEx is awful. 

We ordered a King size headboard. This is something we need delivered as neither of our cars will likely fit the headboard as it's too long. 

Fedex arranged to deliver on a Friday, so I sat at home instead of going to work that day to wait for shipment. 8 hours go by, and I call to double check that it's getting delivered. Confirmed. Then again, I call back at 6pm, they said that it would be here by 8pm. Then I call back at 8:30 and Fedex is ""shocked"" it wasn't delivered. 

Then, we tell them, they'll have to wait until next Friday when someone can be home again to receive the package. 

Monday, I get a text notification that they attempted delivery. On Tuesday, I get a notification that they are shipping it back to Wayfair as they attempted over 3 times... HUH? 

Contacted wayfair, and they issue a refund but no remedy. We really wanted the headboard, not our money back, but they must be too busy to solve the issue.  I see they send via FedEx and UPS, but aren't willing to attempt to resend. What a bummer.

UPDATE: Wayfair has since helped us receive our headboard and happy to report that it's installed in our master bedroom and we couldn't be more elated! Increasing to three stars as they helped us."
Wayfair Canada,2018-09-21T17:12:39Z,2,"Wayfair has great products. I always research before I buy a product from the sellers on their website. Their customer service is great and very helpful but here's the biggest problem... DELIVERY. 

I've ordered 3 furniture items and all of them came damaged. They've either been thrown into my yard, left out in the rain or delivered broken/incomplete. They are very good at sending replacement parts/ replacement furniture but the same thing would happen to the replacement orders. 

I've been issued refunds for all 3 but it cost me to get rid of the furniture."

Wayfair Canada,2018-08-12T13:33:49Z,3,"My reviews regards pricing. Myself working in the online world selling across Canada on a B2B. I know that if you have a special promo that you use a special price. You give a date of when that special ends so the client knows. This site you never know within a 24 hour delay all can change and your stuck wanting a part that know hows gone up sometimes hundreds of dollars. I've placed a few orders with them  and the last 2 times have had this issue. I've called in and have explained that they need to be showing dates. The nice Bs answer ( Oh well we have so many parts) Doesn't matter the quantity the date is applied to certain parts and not the whole inventory.  Normal stores if there is a special they have a by when date for the consumer. Very un pleased  with the politics of wayfair.  They have now lost a client as well as getting this bad review. 

Hope this can help others before purchasing from them.


UPdate: 16/08/2018

So after getting contacted by Wayfair, they have reviewed and made the correction to the issue. Even though there were issues there customers staff are very nice and polite. Have to give them credit for the work they put into resolving.  Like I say it's not always an on products that keep clients coming back but on how they treat their clients. :-)"
Wayfair Canada,2018-08-05T18:15:36Z,1,"I bought an Auro patio furniture cover from Wayfair last year. Used it two months last summer and two months this summer before it tore and is virtually unusable. Contacted Wayfair about it and they gave me phone number for Auro. Auro said if I had bought it direct from them they would replace it however because I bought it from Wayfair then Wayfair needs to contact them and they would replace it. Wayfair refuses to contact them because they have a policy of a one year warranty. 

When we bought a track light unit from Build.com and the transformer went 3 years later (past warranty), Build contacted the manufacturer and a transformer was mailed to us at no charge.

Wayfair Canada,2018-07-19T19:45:13Z,1,"Someone stole my credit card information and purchased nearly $5000 Canadian Dollars worth of Furniture from Wayfair.ca.

I called Wayfair right away, who cancelled the order after I confirmed my credit card details - fortunately I caught it all in time. They went so far as to tell me that the furniture was to be delivered to my own condo building, but not to my unit. So, I suspect someone would have intercepted and trucked elsewhere, or, there is some really shady in my building.

Even though my information was used to set up and pay for these purchases, and I can prove that it IS my funds, Wayfair would not release details to me. I went to the police, and filed a report. With a week or two, an officer followed up with me, and the Wayfair. Wayfair would not release details on the account, even though these is legitimate proof that this was fraud, and the officer had my permission to follow up fully.

In essence, Wayfair is aiding and enabling career criminals to make a good living in Canada, and protecting fraudsters at the expense of innocent people, We all pay for that with higher bank fees and interest rates, and some people will ultimately get stuck with some criminals bill, while they make off like the bandit they are with the ""privacy protection"" of Wayfair. It's actually appalling. 

I will never do business with Wayfair. And I suggest no one else does either, as they are in effect, in the habit of actually protecting criminals.

Wayfair - change your privacy policies, pronto. If there is confirmed fraud, 
 and the police and victim are calling you, you need some clause where information is automatically released. Funny thing is, the first rep I spoke with told me this was the case - get the police to call and we will release details - but when they called, you pleaded ""but we have to protect our (fraudulent) customers privacy"". Well Wayfair, who respects my privacy - the real customer you took money from for that purchase, and who's identification was probably used to set up the account? And who will hold the crook responsible, and bring them to court, and see that the don't do it all over again to someone else? NO ONE, because you are protecting them.

You are just as bad as the identity/credit card thief - and the thieves know it - that's why they buy from you. Way to go, Wayfair.

UPDATE: Wayfair responded to my review with a generic ""We're sorry you are having trouble with your order"" email. Indicating to me that they didn't even read my review. Hey, Wayfair, READ. I'm having trouble someone else stole my identity and you let them get away with it. As is, I can't get an order number! Even though it was MY information used to set the account up, and my CC used to pay. If it's my information, which I OWN, do I not own the account - even if someone else set it up fraudulently? You might want to think about that for a moment. And please, go back and REREAD! I've sent you my phone number via PM with my phone number - feel free to get someone with authority in your company to call. I'll give you the information you need to look up ""my order"" - i.e. my credit card info and date of transaction. 

I will continue updating here.

I am also pondering if it's worthwhile taking my story to news media - I think other Canadians should be aware that you are hanging us out to dry."
Wayfair Canada,2018-07-07T12:52:23Z,1,Wayfair. Ca. Used to be in English. And they chang it to French. I don't know why ? Most of us live in Ontario do not read French . Other wise I give them 5 star. Can you fix this huge problem. I will appreciated.

Wayfair Canada,2018-07-01T01:15:03Z,1,"Ordered a mattress today. Once I got through the process I got an order number and screen printed it right away.  When I clicked to see the details of my order an error page came up saying the site is under maintenance. When I called customer service the woman said to check back later.

I did not receive a confirmation email for my order as the website claimed I would. I did however look at my bank account to see that the money had been taken out.

Not only that, the customer service rep said the order would show up after the maintenance had finished but that the number I gave her was one number too long. 

When I checked again there was no purchase order under my email address on Wayfairs site.

I've got screenprints of my order confirmation page to send to anyone willing to get me my money back. My Wayfair experience from the get go is hella shady."
Wayfair Canada,2018-06-18T18:55:14Z,1,"I ordered 11 items from Wayfair in the span of 1 month (May 2018) and only one order went smoothly.

- Shipping dates: Typical games Wayfair plays is telling you to expect your item on a certain date.  They then extend this date without informing you (days to weeks).  Will on occasion extend the delivery date then right when you expect it to arrive they will tell you the order is cancelled due to the item being out-of-stock!?!

- Cost: Items are not priced competitively, you simply have ease of access to a large selection however everything I ordered I found cheaper elsewhere

- Misrepresented items:   The photos shown are the BEST these items are going to look, so don't be surprised when the quality is crap and look nothing like the photo.  Only order something that has been previously reviewed and photographed.

- Damage:  Over half of my items arrived with some damage or missing parts. While Wayfair handles this well, you'll still be waiting 3-12 weeks for replacement parts to arrive.  So that coffee table you can get next week, plus their obligatory ""extension"" they tack on after you've paid for your item, quickly becomes an item you'll have set up in your house 5 months later :(

Overall, I would avoid Wayfair at all costs unless you have no time expectation for you new piece and are comfortable with your item not looking anything like the photos."
Wayfair Canada,2018-06-02T00:17:39Z,1,I placed an order for a $1000 worth LED light fixture through express delivery as it was advertised to be delivered on 30th May. I booked an electrician to install the light on my 27 feet high ceiling and therefore the only reason I bought this fixture was that it will deliver two days before my appointment on 1st June. The fixture didn't turn up until 1st June and I had to pay $395 to the electrician for cancellation. Customer service is now ignoring my emails about my bad experience. I will never ever buy anything from wayfair again. A VERY expensive lesson learned. Order details image attached.
Wayfair Canada,2018-05-30T20:22:34Z,4,"I had a problem with delivery and called to complain. The representative told me that there was no complaints office. After insisting to speak to a supervisor, I was put on hold and she never came back. After 30 minutes on the line, I hung up and called back. Wayfair advertises free delivery if you spend $75. I would rather pay extra to have reliable delivery and polite representatives.
After calling back, I spoke with a supervisor who assured me that my complaint would be taken seriously. He contacted UPS and I received my order. Wayfair does value their customers. If you are dissatisfied, they will reach out and work with you to solve the problem. At the end of my experience I would update my rating  to 4 stars."
Wayfair Canada,2018-04-24T22:08:37Z,1,"I am in the middle of a nightmare.I have reordered an armoire 2 times and it has been cancelled 2 times by Wayfare saying I had provided an incorrect billing address . The billing address has been correct both times and is tied into my credit card. The shipping address is different from the billing address (a gift to my daughter who shares the last name) which is noted as shipping address. I have purchase several items successfully from Wayfair all of which have been shipped to a different address than the billing address with no problem.I did speak to someone yesterday who apologized for the confusion and said they would deal with it and get back to me, immediately or in the worse case today  so I can order for the 3rd time this armoire!!. No one has given me the courtesy of a call or email .I do not call this service and am really shocked and disappointed."
Wayfair Canada,2018-02-11T14:48:34Z,5,"I bought a bar stool from them; it was defective; contacted customer service, and they sent me a new one with no hassle. Very pleased."
Wayfair Canada,2018-01-30T20:49:36Z,1,"I ordered a headboard on the 25th fo January and was told by the tracking on their site to expect the headboard to be delivered on the 29th of January so I specifically stayed home for that since it was to big to be left with the concierge. 

On the 29th at around 2pm I contacted Wayfair for the tracking number which they informed me was with Fedex and “just waiting to be picked up from Woodbridge to be delivered today” Using the tracking number I went on the Fedex page and after entering it, all it said was “Label Created” which I thought was odd but decided to trust Wayfair since their site and a real person had told me to expect it. At about 4pm I still hadn’t received anything so I called Fedex and was told that the Label had been created on the 26th so it would appear that the headboard would arrive today because that was standard ground service but at that time Fedex hadn’t received the package from Wayfair. I was then told by Fedex that if they received the package on the Monday (29th), to not expect it till Thursday or Friday realistically. Neither of which day I was planning to be home and the Friday I absolutely couldn’t be home so it would then be pushed to the week after.

With this new information from Fedex that Wayfair had lied to my face I called back Wayfair to lodge a complaint and was told “thats just how shipping works sometimes” and “we can’t do anything about it, its like the weather” and “sometimes the tracking doesn’t update because it just gets all stuck up”. I told them quite frankly that I had spoken with Fedex and I didn’t need to be told why I wasn’t receiving my package or any more southern anecdotes comparing shipping to the weather but that this was the first and last time I would be ordering from them because they had been deceptive and purposefully mislead me, wasting my time. She responded “ok” and asked if there was anything else they could do for me. I said no and that you can expect to see this experience on every place I can review your company."
Wayfair Canada,2017-12-07T20:30:24Z,1,"Incompetent or just dishonest? This was the worst purchasing experience I can remember. Two weeks after failing to process the items by the specified shipping date on the email, I called and was told that a clerical error on their end in regard to wholesale pricing was holding up payment, that this would be rectified and a follow-up call/email would be made the next day. No follow-up call or email came to confirm and after phoning back I was told that a $180 discount would be applied to the original purchase and those funds would be processes onto my account. (Sounds like good news?) Not only was there no money reimbursed onto my card, but a new discounted payment was attempted to be taken off my card until I intercepted the bogus mark through my bank and the original cancelled payment would show up on my card within 3-5 business days. This would’ve left me with two outstanding payments totalling $2,200 in the hole with nothing but vague assurances that the items I originally ordered would be shipped. This was the final straw. PLEASE stay away from this company! The lack of communication, integrity and competency I dealt with between the departments of Wayfair was disturbing and in this day and age it’s not worth the risk. Going forward, I plan to either shop locally or through Amazon, Walmart or Costco. Never again, Wayfair!"
Wayfair Canada,2017-12-02T16:40:44Z,1,"I placed the order of the cat tree for my cat on November 19th and my credit card got changed on November 23 for the amount of $116. Instead of shipping the item to me, they voided the shipment to UPS. On both UPS and Wayfair websites, the tracking show the seller voided the shipment on November 22. I had to call the customer service to get my refund. This is a joke, the company cancel my item and then took my money a day after. This is last time I order anything from this company. Unethical practices. I’ll stick with Amazon and decide to purchase the cat tree from Amazon instead. If there is 0 star, I would give them 0 star already."
Wayfair Canada,2017-11-02T13:33:34Z,1,"wayfair sent me two beds instead of one. Charged for two. Returning has been going on for over a week now. UPS was supposed to pick up. They came twice and refused to pickup the return package saying that it does not have a label on it. There is a number which wayfair gave me which I wrote on the package. UPS is supposed to look at this wayfair number on the package and print a return label themselves according to wayfair. Anyways, this has been going back and forth for over a week and the return package is still sitting in my front porch. Looks like the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing."
Wayfair Canada,2017-07-18T15:10:03Z,1,"Our experience buying a swim spa from Wayfair was deplorable! One hand did not know what the other one was doing from the quote specialist to the  delivery specialist. On the confirmation email they specifically indicated that they would deliver and unload the swim spa. After it was ordered they sent us an email that we were responsible for the unloading.We received numerous emails stating the spa was backordered and they were out of stock. We were told we would be contacted when it was shipped. We were not contacted. The last email we got was that the spa would be delivered on or before July 19.  June 21 We got a call from the place we had it shipped to that it had arrived. We were not ready for it!  It arrived full of water, filthy, stairs were nicked and it was the wrong colour!!! There has been no response to any of the emails I have sent regarding these issues. This whole experience has been a nightmare!"
Wayfair Canada,2017-03-24T19:32:46Z,5,One of the items I received was not as well finished as the identical second one which was ordered and delivered at the same time. Wayfair have agreed to send a replacement without the return of the original and have taken my comments purely on trust. This speaks volumes about the customer service at Wayfair and I will be only too pleased to order further items in the future.
